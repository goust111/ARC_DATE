# Variant of 8b7bacbf
# Dimension: D6 — 变换操作类型 (transform)

# Design analysis for the D6 variant
# ----------------------------------
# concrete_behavior:
#   input:
#     - Same object vocabulary as the base task: 1-2 unique border seed pixels, one 8-connected
#       line per seed, and several single-color frame loops whose cavities are background.
#     - A fillable loop is still a one-color ring touched externally by the seed's traced line.
#   output:
#     - Base task behavior would keep the ring and recolor only the cavity interior.
#     - Variant behavior recolors the cavity interior with the seed color AND erases the ring
#       itself to background, so the old hollow loop turns into a solid seed-colored block with
#       background around it where the ring used to be.
#   trace_example:
#     - Suppose a 2x2 cavity sits inside a ring of color 4 and is attached to a line whose seed is 7.
#     - Base task: the 2x2 interior becomes 7, the color-4 ring stays visible.
#     - Variant: the 2x2 interior becomes 7, and every ring pixel becomes background. The frame
#       disappears; only the filled interior remains.
# complexity_calibration:
#   - The variant changes only the terminal writeback step, which matches the complexity pattern of
#     source task 3dc255db: detect a structure, erase part of it, and write a transformed result.
#   - We keep 1-2 seeds, 1-9 loops, and the same ring geometry so the puzzle is still anchored by
#     repeated evidence rather than by a one-off special case.
# implicit_assumption_review:
#   - Seed detection still relies on "non-bg color appearing exactly once on the border". Unchanged.
#   - Line tracing still assumes each seed reaches its own non-bg 8-component. Unchanged.
#   - Cavity discovery still assumes a valid cavity is a 4-connected bg region not connected to a bg
#     corner and enclosed by a single-color boundary. Unchanged.
#   - The changed step is the final writeback: base code only wrote seed color into bg cavity cells.
#     That was harmless because rings were meant to survive. In the variant, leaving the ring intact
#     would silently revert to the old task, so matched boundary pixels must also be rewritten to bg.
# placement_legality:
#   - Generator keeps the old placement checks: rings and cavities are empty, rings do not touch
#     foreign colors, and attached rings are 8-adjacent to their own line but not cavity-adjacent to it.
#   - Those checks are still sufficient because ring erasure only removes pixels; it never creates
#     overlap or new recognition ambiguity in the input.
# visual_observability:
#   - The generator now rejects any sample unless the oracle output has both bg->seed changes
#     (interior filling) and non-bg->bg changes (ring erasure). This guarantees the D6 behavior is
#     visible and prevents degenerate samples that merely look like the original task.
# cleanliness_and_color_inference:
#   - Colors keep their original roles: seed color labels the filled region; frame colors are only
#     structural and disappear when their cavity is activated. Distractor loops remain intact, so the
#     solver can infer that "only loops connected to a seed line vanish".
