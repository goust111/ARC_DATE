# Variant of 142ca369
# Dimension: D9 — 输出网格形状 (grid_shape)
# Change: 输出与输入尺寸相同（same size）——在原网格上叠加射线轨迹... → 仅输出射线轨迹（移除箭头和墙壁）

# Design analysis for the D9 variant
# ==================================
# a) Concretization and behavior trace
#    Input is unchanged: black background, several 3-cell L-shaped arrows, and
#    colored walls (1-pixel or 3-pixel axis-aligned segments). Each arrow emits
#    a diagonal ray that bounces off walls and inherits wall colors exactly as
#    in the original task.
#    Original output = input objects + newly generated ray cells.
#    Variant output = only the newly generated ray cells on a blank background.
#    Example: if an arrow of color 2 starts at its right-angle corner, moves to
#    a background cell, then side-touches a wall of color 7, the original output
#    shows the arrow, the wall, and the ray; the variant keeps only the ray
#    cells, with the bounce cell recolored to 7, while the arrow and wall cells
#    are reset to background.
# b) Complexity calibration
#    The ray geometry, bounce count, color inheritance, arrow count, and wall
#    layout stay unchanged, so the puzzle is not simplified into plain diagonal
#    drawing. The only removed information is the persistence of original
#    objects in the output, which directly tests whether a solver distinguishes
#    "pre-existing pixels" from "generated pixels".
# c) Hidden-assumption audit against the original main()
#    - `out = g.copy()` depended on the old rule that arrows/walls survive in
#      the output. This is invalid now; the output base must be pure bg.
#    - Writes guarded by `out[...] == bg` used to avoid overwriting existing
#      input objects already copied into `out`. In the variant, drawability must
#      instead be decided from the input grid `g`: only cells that were bg in
#      the input count as generated ray cells.
#    - Color adoption at bounces remains valid, but recoloring must still target
#      the current ray cell, never the wall cell itself.
#    - Arrow cells still act as blockers during tracing, even though they vanish
#      from the output, because the input semantics did not change.
# d) Placement legality
#    Generator keeps the original output-first path planning: arrows, rays, and
#    walls are non-overlapping, in-bounds, and each planned wall touches only
#    one ray bounce cell. The committed input still contains arrows and walls,
#    but the planned output stores only ray cells.
# e) Visual observability
#    The difference is immediately visible because every example contains at
#    least one arrow in the input and at least three ray pixels in the output.
#    Most examples also contain walls/bounces, so humans can see that colored
#    blockers influence the ray yet disappear from the result.
# f) Visual cleanliness
#    Removing arrows/walls from the output actually reduces clutter. Because the
#    generator already forbids overlaps among arrows, walls, and rays, the
#    remaining ray-only output stays visually clean and unambiguous.
# g) Color inference
#    Color behavior is unchanged: ray segments start in arrow color and switch to
#    wall color at bounces. Since walls remain visible in the input, humans can
#    still infer the source of each color change from a few examples.
