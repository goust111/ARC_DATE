# Variant of 9385bd28
# Dimension: D8 — 轨迹：标记像素的去留 (trajectory)
# Change: 保留标记 — 标记 L 形角和图例在输出中保持不变... → 标记变色为填充色
#
# Design analysis
# a) Concrete behavior and trace
#    - Input still has the same two object families:
#      1. a bottom-left vertical legend whose rows are (marker_color, fill_color)
#      2. off-legend markers, usually two 3-pixel L corners on one bbox diagonal, sometimes a solid 2x2 block
#    - The original task already fills the whole bbox determined by the opposite diagonal.
#      The only D8 change is what happens to the marker pixels after that fill is chosen.
#    - Old execution on an L-pair:
#      marker color 2 at TL and BR, fill color 6 in the legend
#      -> detect TL-BR as the anchored diagonal
#      -> fill the full bbox with 6
#      -> but keep the six marker pixels at color 2 because current-marker cells are added to `protect`
#    - New execution on the same object:
#      -> detect the same diagonal
#      -> fill the same bbox with 6
#      -> do not protect the current marker pixels, so the six L pixels are overwritten to 6
#      -> recolor the legend marker cell from 2 to 6 as well
#      Difference: the rectangle becomes visually solid; the markers are "absorbed" instead of surviving.
#
# b) Complexity calibration
#    - The diagonal-disambiguation problem is unchanged, so the task does not collapse into simple bbox filling.
#    - We keep both TL-BR and TR-BL anchor diagonals, optional 2x2 blocks, optional no-op legend rows,
#      and optional distractors, preserving the original inference load.
#    - To make D8 visible, generator fills avoid `bg` and avoid the marker's own color, so recoloring is
#      normally observable on both the scattered markers and the legend row.
#
# c) Old assumptions that must be revised
#    - `protect |= (g == marker) & (~legend_mask)` is the key old assumption: it encodes "current L markers survive".
#      In this variant that assumption is false, so current-marker protection must be removed.
#    - `legend_mask` still must protect legend cells from unrelated fills, but the current legend marker cell
#      should be explicitly recolored to its row's fill color after the row is interpreted.
#    - The solver must keep reading all structure from the original grid `g`, not from `out`, otherwise recolored
#      legend cells from earlier rows could corrupt later interpretation.
#
# d) Placement legality
#    - The generator still forbids placement in the legend-scan corridor so `_find_legend` remains reliable.
#    - Objects still cannot overlap at input time; only output-time fills may overlap, exactly as in the original task.
#    - Valid L-pair bbox sizes remain restricted to shapes that do not create diagonal-score ties.
#
# e) Visual observability
#    - At least one legend entry must remain an actual L-pair; otherwise the defining "absorbed corner" effect might
#      disappear from a sample that only has a block and a no-op row.
#    - Fill colors are chosen from colors different from both `bg` and the row's marker color, so the new trajectory
#      is usually visible in 2-3 examples without relying on hidden color-id conventions.
#
# f) Visual cleanliness
#    - The original overlap regime is retained because later fills already provided a readable precedence rule.
#      No extra ornament is introduced.
#    - The legend stays in the same place and the marker geometry stays the same, so the only new visual change is
#      the disappearance of the marker color after filling.
#
# g) Color-change inferability
#    - The recolor target is always locally cued by the legend row itself: marker cell -> adjacent fill cell.
#    - Because the same fill color is used for the rectangle interior and for the absorbed marker pixels, the mapping
#      is structurally supported rather than depending on arbitrary palette arithmetic.

    Paint regions indicated by diagonal corner markers using the bottom-left legend.

    Input structure:
    - The background dominates the grid, and the bottom-left corner holds a vertical 2-column legend.
    - Each legend row stores a marker color in the first column and the rectangle's paint color beside it.
    - Away from the legend, each active marker color appears either as two opposite L corners or as a solid 2x2 block.

    Rule:
    - Read the legend from bottom to top and gather all non-legend pixels of that marker color.
    - For an L-pair, detect which bbox diagonal carries the two L anchors; the opposite diagonal determines the filled bbox.
    - Recolor every cell of that filled region to the legend's paint color, including the marker pixels themselves.
    - For a 2x2 block, simply recolor the four block cells to the legend's paint color.
    - Legend cells and later marker colors are still protected from unrelated earlier fills, but the current legend marker cell
      also changes to its row's paint color.

    Key insight:
    - The L corners are temporary guides, not permanent outlines: they reveal which diagonal is the marker diagonal,
      then get absorbed into the same color as the completed rectangle.
