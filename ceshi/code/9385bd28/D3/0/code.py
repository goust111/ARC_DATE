# Design analysis for the D3 variant
# ----------------------------------
# concretization:
#   The legend and marker placement stay the same as the source task: a vertical
#   legend at bottom-left maps marker colors to fill colors; each active marker
#   object is either one L-pair (six pixels on one bbox diagonal) or a solid 2x2
#   block. The output change is local to the painted destination area: for an
#   L-pair, the whole bounding rectangle is now painted in the legend's fill
#   color, and the six marker pixels are no longer preserved as visible corners.
#   The 2x2 block case already behaved like a fully recolored rectangle, so it
#   remains unchanged.
# flow_trace:
#   Example: marker color 2 forms TL+BR L-corners on a 4x5 bbox and the legend
#   maps 2 -> 7. Old behavior filled that bbox with 7 but kept the six marker
#   pixels as color 2, producing a rectangle with corner notches. New behavior
#   paints every unprotected cell in the 4x5 bbox with 7, so those six marker
#   pixels are swallowed. Future legend markers and the legend itself are still
#   protected exactly as before, so the only semantic shift is "current marker
#   pixels no longer survive their own fill".
# complexity_calibration:
#   The variant is intentionally narrow: the legend, object vocabulary, order of
#   processing, distractors, and bbox discovery remain unchanged. This keeps the
#   reasoning load close to the original while making the visible difference
#   strong: at least one training-like object must now lose its marker corners.
#   To prevent degenerate samples where old/new outputs match, the generator
#   rejects inputs whose variant-vs-legacy output delta is too small.
# old_implicit_assumptions_review:
#   - The original `_diamond_mask` call is effectively a bbox fill here because
#     the chosen endpoints are opposite rectangle corners; the true old-vs-new
#     difference is not the outer shape but whether current marker pixels are in
#     `protect`.
#   - The old branch `protect |= (g == marker)` depended on the invariant that
#     current markers should remain visible. That invariant is false in D3, so
#     keeping the line would silently revert to the old task.
#   - The block branch recolors its own 2x2 pixels directly; this is still valid
#     because blocks were already fully overwritten and do not encode the changed
#     "marker survives" semantics.
# placement_validity:
#   The generator still forbids overlap in the input grid, still keeps the legend
#   scan corridor clear, and still uses bbox sizes that avoid ambiguous diagonal
#   anchor scores. Because the solver now validates the same L-anchor geometry as
#   before, generated L-pairs must continue to satisfy those corner patterns.
# visual_observability:
#   A human should be able to infer the new rule from 2-4 examples because the
#   corner markers disappear inside their own colored rectangles instead of staying
#   as a different color. To make that visible, legend fills are sampled from
#   colors different from the marker color, and generation rejects samples where
#   the new output differs from the legacy output in fewer than three cells.
# visual_cleanliness:
#   The input remains sparse and non-overlapping; only output rectangles may
#   overlap through processing order, which is already part of the base task.
#   Protecting future markers keeps later objects readable in the input and
#   prevents the output from collapsing into ambiguous merged blobs too early.
# color_inference:
#   No hidden ordering by color id is introduced. Colors are still explained only
#   by the visible legend, and the variant does not add any new color transform.
# new_solver_assumptions_after_edit:
#   - Non-block legend markers still occupy exactly one bbox and either form a
#     valid L-pair or are absent.
#   - Future markers remain disjoint in the input so protecting them preserves
#     their detectability for later passes.
#   - The generator enforces a nonzero visible swallow delta, so `main()` is not
#     evaluated only on cases that accidentally look like the legacy task.

    - Away from the legend, each active marker color appears either as two opposite L-corners of one bbox or as a solid 2x2 block.

    Rule:
    - Read legend entries from bottom to top and locate all non-legend pixels of that marker color.
    - A 2x2 block is simply recolored to its fill color.
    - An L-pair paints its entire axis-aligned bounding rectangle with the mapped fill color, including the marker pixels themselves.
    - Legend cells and markers belonging to later legend rows stay protected so later objects remain detectable and can overwrite earlier fills.

    Key insight: The L-corners still identify which bbox belongs to each legend color, but unlike the source task the corners do not survive; once a marker's turn arrives, its own rectangle swallows it.
