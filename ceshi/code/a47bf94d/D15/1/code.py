# Variant of a47bf94d
# Dimension: D15 — 输出网格尺寸 (grid_shape)
# Change: 尺寸不变（same）——输出网格与输入网格尺寸完全相同... → 仅输出token行
#
# Design analysis
# - Reference task check:
#   - The prompt cites `e87109e9` as the source of the tight-crop idea.
#   - In this workspace only `/home/lixinyu/snap/new/ARC-data/ARC-AGI-2/data/evaluation/e87109e9.json`
#     exists; no readable solver `.py` for that task was present under `/home/lixinyu/snap/new`.
#   - I therefore keep the crop mechanism conservative: solve the original routing task first,
#     then emit only the two token bands, without introducing any extra legend/crop logic.
# - a) Concrete behavior and trace:
#   - Original behavior: output is the full HxW board, including wires, 9-rect junctions, top
#     diamonds, and bottom X tokens.
#   - Variant behavior: the logical routing is unchanged, but the visible output is reduced to
#     six rows: the 3-row band around the top token centers stacked directly above the 3-row band
#     around the bottom token centers. Width stays unchanged so horizontal channel alignment is
#     still readable.
#   - Example trace: if a solid 3x3 at top column c routes through the wire network to bottom
#     column d, the original solver draws a top diamond at c, a bottom X at d, and keeps the
#     entire pipe maze. The variant still computes those same token results, but returns only the
#     rows `[top-1:top+2]` and `[bottom-1:bottom+2]`, so the maze rows vanish.
# - b) Complexity calibration:
#   - I do not crop columns, so channel spacing and permutation evidence remain visible.
#   - I do not alter token shapes or colors, preserving the original disambiguation between solid,
#     X, and diamond patterns.
#   - The main new burden is remembering/inferencing the hidden routing; there is no added branch
#     explosion beyond that.
# - c) Implicit-assumption audit of the original `main()`:
#   - The original `out = g.copy()` and later in-place writes assume the full canvas is returned.
#     That is no longer true, so the full solve is moved into `_solve_full_output()` and the public
#     `main()` performs a second-stage crop.
#   - The original solver never needed to know token-band rows explicitly. The variant does, so
#     `_infer_token_center_rows()` reconstructs them from wire endpoints rather than from already
#     present far-end tokens, which may be absent in the input.
#   - Any code that would crop by all non-background rows would fail here, because top and bottom
#     token bands are separated by the omitted wire corridor. The crop must be endpoint-aware.
# - d) Placement legality:
#   - Generator keeps the original spacing, endpoint gap, and non-identity permutation, so all
#     tokens still fit and remain non-overlapping.
#   - The cropped output rows are exactly one cell away from the endpoints, so they never include
#     wire cells, crossing markers, or 9-rects.
# - e) Visual observability:
#   - Across samples, inputs remain large pipe mazes while outputs are always compact 6xW strips.
#     That difference is obvious from 2-3 examples without relying on hidden ids or metadata.
# - f) Visual cleanliness:
#   - Stacking only the two 3-row token bands avoids mixing token shapes with wires. The output is
#     sparse but clean: each channel still occupies its original column, and no pipe cells remain.
# - g) Color-change inferability:
#   - No new color mapping is introduced. Colors still identify channels exactly as in the original
#     task, so the crop does not create any new color ambiguity.
# - h) Variant-behavior metric used after implementation:
#   - For generated samples, the key metric is `output_rows == 6` and `output` contains no wire
#     colors `{5, 8, 9}`. Additionally, comparing to the original full solver on the same input
#     should show a shape mismatch on every sample, proving the D15 crop is active.
# - i) New solver assumptions to guarantee in the generator:
#   - Every wire component has degree-1 endpoints from which an outward token center can be inferred.
#   - Those inferred centers occupy exactly two distinct rows (top and bottom bands).
#   - Each token band is a clean 3-row strip fully inside the grid. The generator already enforces
#     this via `top_token_row in {2,3}` and `bottom_token_row = H-top_token_row-1`.
