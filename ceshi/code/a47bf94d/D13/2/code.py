# Variant of a47bf94d
# Dimension: D13 — 多步处理顺序 (multi_step)
# Change: 单步变换——每个token独立执行一次分解和传输操作，各通道之间没有顺序依赖... → 先拆分后路由两步

# Design analysis for the D13 variant
# a) Concrete behavior:
#    - The geometry stays top/bottom channels with the same wire language (8/5/9).
#    - A solid 3x3 token is interpreted as "diamond + X" stacked on the same center.
#      In phase 1 every solid is conceptually split into those two parts.
#    - In phase 2 every X-shaped token near an endpoint moves through the wire to the
#      opposite endpoint. When the mover came from a solid, removing the X leaves the
#      source-side diamond behind. When the mover was an input X, its source becomes empty.
#      If the destination already contains a static diamond, the arriving X completes a solid.
#    - Small trace example:
#      old rule on an input-X channel: source X stays, far side receives a diamond.
#      new rule on the same channel: source X leaves, far side receives the X itself.
#      If a far diamond was pre-placed, the old rule ends as X+diamond on opposite sides,
#      while the new rule ends as a completed solid on the far side only.
# b) Complexity calibration:
#    - The wire routing, crossings, and 9-rect pass-through are preserved so the task
#      remains structurally rich.
#    - We force 1-2 X-input channels per sample so the new multi-step behavior is
#      visible; the remaining channels stay solid so the split phase also appears.
# c) Hidden assumptions audited:
#    - Original main() relied on the fact that only solids and Xs needed to be removed
#      from the track mask. That is no longer safe because static destination diamonds
#      should not merge into the wire component; a diamond detector is added.
#    - Original routing copied X tokens in place. The variant instead removes X-cells
#      from every mover source before stamping the moved X at the destination.
#    - Routing still assumes each token center is exactly two cells outside an endpoint;
#      generator construction keeps that invariant.
# d) Placement legality:
#    - Channel spacing and token rows are unchanged, so 3x3 neighborhoods do not overlap.
#    - Static diamonds are only placed on the far end of a channel, never on a source end.
#    - All token cells are removed from the track mask, so endpoint degree and tracing stay valid.
# e) Visual observability:
#    - Every sample contains at least one moving input X; otherwise many samples would
#      collapse to the original final state for solid-only inputs.
#    - Static far diamonds appear often enough that humans can see "arrival completes shape"
#      in some examples, but not so often that every endpoint looks filled in advance.
# f) Visual cleanliness:
#    - Only one token center exists at each endpoint location, and wire colors remain disjoint
#      from token colors. No extra markers are introduced.
# g) Color reasoning:
#    - Colors are unchanged identities, one color per channel. No sorting or color remapping
#      is introduced; inference comes from shape motion and endpoint position only.
