# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Design analysis for the D11 variant
#
# spec_variant:
#   core_change:
#     channels: 6-8 vertical channels instead of 4-5
#     spacing: uniform spacing 3-4 so the larger channel count still fits
#     canvas: widened to 28-38 columns and 28-38 rows
#     routing: every sample uses one dense permutation cycle, so all channels
#       participate and the wire must perform N+1 crossover steps via bypass
#   concrete_appearance:
#     - Tokens still sit in aligned top and bottom rows, centered two cells
#       away from the wire endpoints.
#     - The middle band now contains many more simultaneous vertical stems.
#       Because the stems are closer together and every channel moves, the
#       horizontal crossover rows appear much more frequently.
#     - Color-9 rectangles remain optional pass-through junctions, but larger
#       networks can host more of them.
#   behavior_trace:
#     old:
#       - With 4-5 channels, the generator could keep width <= 26 while using
#         spacing 4-5. A random non-identity permutation often left some lanes
#         fixed, so some grids had only a handful of crossovers.
#     new:
#       - With 6-8 channels, keeping spacing 4-5 would either exceed the
#         original width budget or make placement fail frequently.
#       - The generator therefore compresses spacing to 3-4, widens the grid,
#         and forces a single permutation cycle so all lanes take part in the
#         bypass-based rerouting.
#       - Example: for N=8, the old generator might use a 2-cycle plus fixed
#         points, giving only 3 crossover rows. The new generator uses one
#         8-cycle, yielding 9 crossover rows, so the same token rule is now
#         expressed through a visibly denser backbone.
#   complexity_calibration:
#     - Channel count is restricted to {6,7,8}; this is enough to be visually
#       distinct without making placement uncontrolled.
#     - Extra colors are not available in the ARC palette because 5/8/9 are
#       reserved for the wire. For N>6, token colors may repeat, but repeats
#       are capped so any color appears at most twice. This keeps the variant
#       feasible without changing the rule itself.
#     - The rule still uses only the original three token shapes, so the added
#       difficulty comes from routing density rather than from extra object
#       types.
#   implicit_assumption_audit:
#     - _find_solid_3x3 / _find_x_3x3 do not assume a fixed number of tokens;
#       they only need 3x3 patterns to stay isolated. The tighter spacing of 3
#       still leaves a one-column gap between neighboring token footprints.
#     - main() scans wire endpoints and looks two cells outward for token
#       centers. This assumes EP_TOKEN_GAP stays 2; the generator preserves it.
#     - _trace_wire relies on crossing markers and 9-rect face structure, not
#       on grid size. Denser networks are safe as long as crossover rows remain
#       ordered and at least two rows apart; the generator enforces that.
#     - Token colors are no longer unique when N>6. main() never keys tokens by
#       color, only by center position, so solver logic remains valid.
#   legality_checks:
#     - Generator builds channels with explicit margins, then rejects widths
#       outside the expanded canvas range.
#     - Crossover rows are monotone and spaced by 2-3 rows, which prevents
#       vertical segments from collapsing into each other.
#     - 9-rect placement still checks overlap, border clearance, and compatible
#       wire entries/exits before committing.
#   observability:
#     - From a few examples, the human-visible difference is immediate: the top
#       and bottom token rows contain many more lanes, the middle contains many
#       more horizontal exchange rows, and the same local token transformation
#       is seen repeated across a much denser transport network.
