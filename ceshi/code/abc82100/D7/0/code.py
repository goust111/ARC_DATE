# Design analysis for the D7 variant
# ----------------------------------
# - Concrete behavior:
#   The input still contains several local legends. Each legend is a 4-neighbor
#   source-color pixel next to a target-color pixel, extended one more step to a
#   teal stencil anchor. Elsewhere, isolated source-color pixels are the real
#   objects to transform. In the original task, both the legend pair and the teal
#   stencil vanished in the output. In this variant, only teal vanishes; the two
#   colored legend pixels remain visible in place.
# - Trace of the changed stage:
#   Suppose a rule example is "blue, red, teal-shape" and there is another blue
#   pixel elsewhere. Originally the output erased the legend's blue/red pair and
#   stamped the teal shape in red around the scattered blue pixel. Here the same
#   stamp still happens, but the legend's blue and red pixels remain. The only
#   deleted pixels are teal cells.
# - Complexity calibration:
#   The rule mechanism is unchanged: 1-4 rules, each repeated by 3-8 scattered
#   source pixels. This keeps repeated evidence for each color mapping and avoids
#   overloading the task with extra degrees of freedom. The D7 change is visually
#   obvious because every example output retains the colored legend pair(s).
# - Implicit-assumption audit for main():
#   The original preservation loop assumed any pixel whose color is a learned
#   source color should disappear unless it is an unrelated bystander. That was
#   safe only because legend pixels were also meant to disappear. In this variant,
#   that assumption is false for legend source pixels, so the loop must preserve
#   coordinates identified as legend cells before applying the "erase scattered
#   sources" rule by color. There is a second hidden dependency: the old stamping
#   pass could overwrite legend coordinates and still be correct because legends
#   were deleted later. Now legend colors must be restored after stamping.
# - Placement legality:
#   The generator still keeps legends, scattered sources, and bystanders
#   4-neighbor separated at input time, preventing accidental fake legends. Teal
#   stencils stay attached only to their own legend. Output stamps may overlap or
#   clip exactly as in the seed task.
# - Visual observability / cleanliness:
#   The retained legend pair creates a stable, local cue in every output: humans
#   can see that the teal guide disappears but the adjacent color pair remains.
#   Since only teal is removed, there is no hidden dependence on color ids or
#   ordering.
# - New solver assumptions and generator support:
#   The solver assumes discovered legend coordinates are exactly the pixels to
#   preserve among learned source colors. The generator guarantees this by keeping
#   all other source-colored pixels isolated from target-colored neighbors and
#   validating every sampled grid with main(input) == expected_output.

    Learn local source-target-stencil examples and stamp them onto matching sources.

    Input structure:
    - A black-background grid containing isolated colored pixels and teal (8)
      stencil components.
    - Each rule example is a 4-neighbor source->target colored pair whose forward
      continuation reaches an anchor touching the associated teal stencil.

    Rule:
    - For every discovered rule, copy its teal stencil onto every non-legend pixel
      of the same source color, recoloring the copied stencil to the rule's target
      color and aligning the rule anchor to that source pixel.
    - Remove all teal stencil pixels from the output.
    - Keep the colored rule-example pair itself; only teal is erased from the
      legend region.

    Key insight: The adjacent colored pair is a persistent legend, not a disposable
    object. It tells you which source color triggers which recolored stencil, while
    the teal component is just the removable template to stamp elsewhere.
