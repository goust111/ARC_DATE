# Variant of faa9f03d
# Dimension: D6 — 间隙填充条件判断 (transform)
# Change: 面对的端点间隙填充需要两端有轴向支撑（gap>1时两端都需要支撑，gap=1时放宽条件）；两端都是标记的不填充... → 仅填充固定长度以内的间隙
#
# Design analysis
# - concretization:
#   - The visible change is a repaired straight bridge between two already-identified
#     endpoints when the missing run is short enough, even if the old support test
#     would have rejected it.
#   - Generator now creates at least one "bridge" case: two red singleton markers sit
#     on the two turn/end cells that bound a straight span, and the interior 2-3 cells
#     of that span are removed in the input. After recoloring the markers, the new
#     solver fills the short span purely by length; the original solver would reject
#     the same pair because both endpoints are markers and gap>1.
# - behavior trace:
#   - old: marker endpoints are assigned a line color, but `should_fill` refuses
#     marker-marker gaps longer than 1, so the middle stays blank.
#   - new: after the same marker assignment, `should_fill` only checks gap length,
#     so the missing cells between those marker endpoints are restored.
# - complexity calibration:
#   - The threshold is fixed at 3 cells. The generator samples bridge gaps of length
#     2 or 3 so the new rule is exercised repeatedly without exploding the search.
#   - Yellow controls and crossing disambiguation stay intact; they provide the same
#     multi-object context as the base task, so the variant is not reduced to a
#     standalone gap-filling puzzle.
# - implicit assumptions audited:
#   - Marker assignment still relies on nearest row/column line-of-sight with the
#     original support-preference tie-break. This remains valid because bridge markers
#     are placed on existing polyline turn/end cells, so each marker still sees its
#     own color at distance 1.
#   - Crossing resolution still uses pre-fill component counts. Bridge interiors are
#     removed from the generator's `comp_count_masks`, so solver and target use the
#     same fragmentation signal.
#   - The new solver assumes short bridge gaps are axis-aligned between same-color
#     visible cells in one row/column. Generator guarantees this by selecting marker
#     pairs from maximal straight runs inside a single logical component.
# - placement legality:
#   - Bridge interiors exclude crossings, yellow rays, and old yellow arms.
#   - Bridge marker endpoints are reserved before extra markers/yellow controls are
#     placed, preventing overlap, adjacency conflicts, and accidental reuse.
# - visual observability:
#   - In every generated input there is at least one red-red pair with a 2-3 cell
#     blank corridor between them; in the output that corridor is restored as a
#     straight segment. This is directly visible from a few samples.
# - cleanliness:
#   - The bridge gap is carved from one existing span instead of stacking new object
#     types on top of the old scene, so the image remains legible.
# - color inference:
#   - No invisible ordering is introduced. The filled color is still determined by
#     visible line-of-sight assignment from the red markers to neighboring line
#     fragments.

    Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by recoloring singleton markers, filling only bounded-length axis gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

    Input structure:
    - A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
    - Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
    - Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all isolated single pixels.
    - Red markers sit on missing turn/endpoint cells, and some of them bracket a short blank corridor; yellow markers sit just beyond a line endpoint and indicate a rerouted arm.

    Rule:
    - Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, breaking ties toward the same-axis endpoint-supported sightline.
    - For each line color, whenever two consecutive same-color cells face each other in one row or column, fill the intervening gap iff its length is at most 3.
    - A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
    - At crossings, yellow-control rays take priority; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while a crossing formed only by filled cells uses the lower color id.

    Key insight: The singleton markers still tell you which fragments belong to the same polyline, but the bridge decision is now numeric rather than structural: once markers are recolored, any short enough straight gap is intended to be completed, regardless of endpoint support geometry.
