# Variant of a47bf94d
# Dimension: D12 — 输入中token的初始状态 (src)
# Change: 混合输入——大部分通道以实心3x3块作为输入token，0-2个通道以X形作为输入token；X形通道的远端约67%留空... → 全部实心输入

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Design analysis for D12
#
# a) Concrete behavior and flow impact
# - Pixels still contain the same wire language as the base task: teal wires (8),
#   grey crossing markers (5), optional maroon pass-through rectangles (9), and
#   3x3 colored tokens whose centers sit exactly two cells away from degree-1
#   wire endpoints.
# - The D12 change removes the mixed token vocabulary from the input. Every
#   channel now starts from exactly one solid 3x3 block. There are no input X
#   tokens and no far-end pre-placed diamonds.
# - Small example: if a red solid block is placed above a top endpoint, the base
#   solver used to consider two cases at that endpoint: "solid here" or "X here".
#   In this variant only the solid case exists. The red 3x3 becomes a local
#   diamond, then the wire trace finds the opposite endpoint and stamps a red X
#   there. If the solid starts on the bottom side instead, the same operation is
#   mirrored: bottom becomes diamond, top receives the X.
#
# b) Complexity calibration
# - The puzzle remains nontrivial because the solver still has to detect 3x3
#   blocks, remove them from the wire mask, trace permutations through crossings
#   and 9-rect pass-throughs, and stamp complementary shapes at the far ends.
# - Complexity is reduced only in one visible place: all input examples show
#   solid sources only. The output still mixes diamonds and Xs, so the
#   decomposition/transmission rule remains observable.
#
# c) Hidden-assumption audit for main()
# - The original main() depended on two token finders: solids and isolated Xs.
#   After D12, any branch that routes from an X source becomes dead logic.
# - track_mask originally removed both solid cells and X cells. In the variant
#   we remove only solid 3x3 areas; this is safe because generate_input() never
#   places X or diamond cells in the input.
# - Endpoint scanning still checks for a token center exactly two cells away in a
#   cardinal direction. The generator must keep that spacing unchanged.
# - Stamping an X at the destination assumes the 3x3 destination area is free of
#   non-background token pixels in the input. The generator guarantees one token
#   per channel and a permutation mapping, so no two destinations overlap.
#
# d) Placement legality
# - Token centers remain on the fixed top/bottom rows used by the original
#   layout, so every 3x3 block fits within bounds.
# - Wires are built first, then tokens are stamped at endpoint offsets; tokens
#   never overlap wires because the endpoint-to-center offset is fixed at 2.
# - Output uses the actual chosen source side per channel, avoiding the original
#   generator's orientation mismatch rejection.
#
# e) Visual observability
# - Across examples, the input now always contains only full 3x3 blocks. The
#   output reveals the consistent split: a local diamond stays where the block
#   started, and a remote X appears at the other end of the connected wire.
# - This difference is easy to see with 2-4 examples because the missing X-input
#   branch is globally consistent rather than depending on color ids.
#
# f) Visual cleanliness
# - No extra token variants are pre-placed, so endpoint areas are cleaner than in
#   the base task. The only layered structures are the same wire/rect/crossing
#   motifs as before.
#
# g) Color inference
# - Colors are preserved. The variant does not introduce any new color mapping or
#   color-based ordering; each channel still carries one token color unchanged.
