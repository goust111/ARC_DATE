Shear the rectangular input down-left onto a black canvas.

Input structure
A rectangular grid of colored pixels with no internal empty region to infer.

Rule
Create a black output with the same height and width W + H - 1, then copy
each input row r unchanged starting at column H - 1 - r.

Key insight
The colors and row contents are preserved; only the row offsets change so
the left edge forms a descending diagonal.

Recolor a path-network by adjacent seed regions.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Path color P forms a thin orthogonal network with a solid square hub (NxN).
- Seed colors appear in colored regions (non-bg, non-P) adjacent to path branches.

Rule:
- Infer P as the non-bg color whose largest component is most network-like.
- Find the largest solid k×k all-P square (the hub); exclude it from recoloring.
- Recolor each path branch to the seed-region color it touches most.
- Recolor the hub center pixel to the seed whose branches touch the hub most.

Key insight: The hub stays uncolored; branches inherit color from adjacent seed regions by adjacency count.

<description>
Expand the top-left seed mask into a recursive colored pattern and tile it across the full grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- All foreground lies in a top-left rectangle whose last row and last column are a solid secondary color.
- Removing that secondary-color row and column leaves a seed region containing background plus one primary color.

Rule
- Use the primary-color pixels in the seed as a binary mask.
- Replace each primary seed cell with a copy of the seed mask in the primary color, and each background seed cell
  with a copy of the seed mask in the secondary color.
- Repeat and crop that expanded tile to the original grid shape.

Key insight
The solid L-shaped secondary-color border is a legend, not output content; it supplies the color used when the
seed's background cells are expanded.

<description>
Recolor each framed interior mask with the color from the next red frame clockwise around the blue connector cycle.

Input structure
- The grid contains hollow red square frames connected pairwise by blue line components.
- The blue components connect the frames into one cycle, with every frame touching exactly two blue components.
- Each frame interior contains background plus exactly one non-background color mask.

Rule
- Sort the red frames clockwise by their centers around the cycle.
- Keep each frame's interior mask shape in place, but recolor it with the interior color from the next clockwise frame.
- Leave the red frames, blue connectors, background, and interior background holes unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored masks do not move; the blue cycle gives the order in which their colors rotate.

<description>
Move the diagonal foreground segment to the next longer run along the same up-right diagonal.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and one foreground color. The foreground pixels form a
contiguous one-pixel-wide segment on a single anti-diagonal.

Rule
Erase the current segment. If its columns are c0..c1 and its length is L, draw the same
color on columns c1+1..c1+L+1 along the same anti-diagonal.

Key insight
The segment advances past its current upper-right end by one whole segment position, and
the next segment is one pixel longer than the current one.

<description>
List the colors of overlaid straight lines in their only possible bottom-to-top crossing order.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color. Every foreground color is the visible part
of one full one-cell-thick horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal line.
Higher lines may hide pixels of lower lines at crossings.

Rule
Recover each full line from its visible collinear pixels. At any cell where
multiple recovered lines cross, the visible color is above every other line
through that cell. Return the unique ordering of all line colors that respects
those above/below constraints and whose consecutive colors are lines that
geometrically cross.

Key insight
The visible crossing colors give a partial layer order, and the intended answer
is the unique Hamiltonian chain through the line-intersection graph from the
bottom layer to the top layer.

Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Move every foreground object straight downward by a number of rows equal to its own pixel count.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- The foreground is made of separated 4-connected monochromatic objects.
- Objects may move partly below the bottom edge of the grid.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- For each foreground object, compute its area in pixels.
- Redraw the object at the same columns and that many rows lower, clipping pixels below the grid.

Key insight:
- The downward displacement is the object's own area; color and shape only identify which pixels move together.

Draw the marker-colored route through the centers of all doors in the parallel wall maze.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background, parallel full-span walls, one three-pixel door
  segment in each wall, and two marker pixels sharing a color.
- Walls are either all vertical or all horizontal, and the markers are on
  opposite outer sides of the wall set.

Rule:
- Keep the scene unchanged except for the route.
- Visit the door centers in wall order from the upper/left marker side to
  the lower/right marker side.
- In each corridor, draw an orthogonal path to the cell just before the next
  wall, move along that wall to the door center, cross the center, and
  continue to the next corridor; after the last door, connect to the other
  marker.

Key insight:
- The three-pixel door segments mark the only crossing points through a set
  of parallel walls, so the output is the corridor path threaded through
  those centers.

Fill each black 5x5 region's missing interior positions with a fixed 3x3 positional color legend.

Input structure
- The grid uses teal as the dominant background and black for one or more
  5x5 regions.
- Each black region has a black one-pixel border and a 3x3 interior that
  may already contain teal pixels.

Rule
- Overlay the legend 1 7 6 / 4 8 5 / 2 9 3 on the 3x3 interior of every
  5x5 black region.
- Wherever an interior non-center legend position is still black, recolor it
  to the corresponding legend color; leave existing teal pixels, the center,
  and the black border unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored output pixels are not derived from the teal motif shape; they
  are the fixed position labels for the missing cells of each 3x3 interior.

<description>
Recolor the grey diagonal-chain regions in an orange field to teal.

Input structure
The input contains only grey pixels and orange pixels.  Grey pixels form
several 8-connected regions embedded in the orange field.

Rule
Decompose each grey 8-connected region into 4-connected lobes.  Recolor the
whole region teal only when it contains a straight diagonal run of at least
three pixels and those lobes meet only by diagonal corner contacts in a
non-branching diagonal chain or cycle; a single 4-connected region is
recolored only when it is a square diagonal staircase.

Key insight
The teal regions are not selected by size or position; they are the grey
regions whose internal connectivity depends on diagonal corner joins, while
same-edge cracks, rectangles, bars, and branching/noisy regions remain grey.

Transfer center colors between bordered sprites matched by color, keeping only path-connected ones.

Input structure:
- bg, grey (5) path network, and several small "bordered sprites" each having a border color and a single center pixel of a different color.
- Grey path forms a one-stroke trail under 8-connectivity; its start/end cells touch exactly two destination sprites via ports.

Rule:
- Destination sprites are determined by the grey trail's two endpoints.
- For each destination, find the source sprite whose border color equals the destination's center color.
- Replace the destination's center pixel with the source's center color.
- Delete all non-destination sprites; grey paths and destinations remain.

Key insight: Center color of each destination acts as a lookup key into the border colors of other sprites, enabling indirect color transfer.

Paint a recolored diagonal copy from each L triomino source object.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground objects are 4-connected red and grey L triominoes,
  each occupying three pixels of a 2x2 box.

Rule:
- Grey L objects paint a yellow copy translated one diagonal step toward
  their missing 2x2 corner.
- Red L objects paint a green copy translated one diagonal step away from
  their missing 2x2 corner.
- Copies are clipped by the grid boundary; red-derived green copies are
  painted after grey-derived yellow copies where the projections collide.

Key insight:
- The missing corner of each 2x2 L object identifies its diagonal axis, and
  the source color determines which side of that axis receives the copy.

Slide black shapes rightward to a grey separator, then shoot red rays from enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- A vertical grey (5) separator column divides the grid into left and right halves.
- Black shapes sit on the left side against a background color (bg).

Rule:
- Translate each black connected component rightward until its right edge is flush with the separator.
- After sliding, find enclosed bg regions (holes) within the black shapes that touch the column just left of the separator.
- For each row spanned by such a hole, emit a red ray across the entire right half of the grid.

Key insight: Only holes adjacent to the separator trigger rays — the sliding creates enclosures that act as "nozzles" projecting rightward.

Swing an irregular line segment around a nearby obstacle sprite, preserving its pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg, bar color (straight lines perpendicular to the grid edge, one end on the border), segment color (irregular stroke attached to bar's inner endpoint), obstacle color (sprite near the bar terminal).

Rule:
- Each bar is perpendicular to the edge it touches; its inner (terminal) endpoint has an attached irregular segment.
- The segment detaches and re-routes: it travels from the terminal toward the nearest obstacle, hugs the obstacle's boundary, then exits at a 45° diagonal.
- Total painted pixels equal the original segment length.

Key insight: The segment behaves like a rope swung around the obstacle — attach at the nearest point, trace the skin, exit diagonally, conserving length.

Move each colored object vertically until it touches the matching top or bottom border bar.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The top row is a full-width bar in one foreground color and the bottom row is a full-width bar in another.
- All other foreground pixels are 8-connected monochrome objects whose color matches one of those bars.

Rule:
- Top-bar-colored objects move upward so their bbox top is row 1.
- Bottom-bar-colored objects move downward so their bbox bottom is the row above the bottom bar.
- A downward-moving one-column segment whose landing overlaps its source becomes the continuous vertical segment swept between them.

Key insight:
The horizontal bars are destination anchors: color determines which border an object slides toward, while columns and object shape are otherwise preserved.

Build a four-quadrant rotational tiling of the input square.

Input structure
- The input is a square grid treated as one complete sprite.

Rule
- Each output quadrant is a 2x2 repetition of a rotated copy of the whole input.
- The quadrant rotations are upper-left 180 degrees, upper-right 90 degrees
  clockwise, lower-left 90 degrees counterclockwise, and lower-right unchanged.

Key insight
- The output is a 4x4 grid of original-size blocks, not a per-pixel scale-up.

Thicken the sparse frame and stamp the external sparse sprites into it in positional order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a regular lattice color, one large
sparse rectangular frame, and one or more external monochrome sprites whose
pixels also sit on a two-step lattice.

Rule
Use the largest sparse rectangular perimeter as the frame. Clear that frame
region and the external sprite pixels to background, draw a solid one-pixel
border in the frame color, solidify each sparse sprite into its contiguous
two-step mask, and place the sprites inside the frame with equal gaps.
Wide frames receive sprites left-to-right by source position; tall frames
receive them top-to-bottom by source position.

Key insight
The frame supplies ordered slots: the sprite-to-slot assignment is by visible
source order, not by numeric color or by matching individual cells.

Align parallel colored line segments so they all share the same start and end positions as a reference line.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several parallel line segments (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical), each a different color, running in the same direction but starting/ending at different positions.

Rule:
- Detect the dominant direction shared by all segments.
- Pick the median segment (by perpendicular offset) as the reference.
- Shift every segment along the shared direction so its start aligns with the reference's start, then trim or extend it to match the reference's length.
- Grid size stays the same; isolated single pixels are untouched.

Key insight: The reference is the median line, not the longest; all segments are snapped to its extent regardless of their original length.

Fill the rectangle from the lone foreground pixel to its nearest grid corner.

Input structure
- The grid is a uniform background field with exactly one foreground pixel.
- The foreground pixel's color is the color used for all added pixels.

Rule
- Find the grid corner with the smallest Manhattan distance to the foreground pixel.
- Recolor every pixel in the inclusive axis-aligned rectangle bounded by that
  corner and the foreground pixel to the foreground color.

Key insight
- The single pixel is one corner of the rectangle; the opposite corner is the
  nearest corner of the whole canvas.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
本轮每道新题都必须是**多层结构**：规则包含至少两个阶段，每个阶段都需要解题者从样例中主动归纳一个非显然规律，且缺少任何一层都无法得到正确输出。生成的题目中至少有 2 道为三层及以上结构（层数 = 需要各自归纳的阶段数）。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

以上不是可选建议，而是硬性要求：每道新题都必须以本轮参考题的机制为出发点（三种方式任选其一），并在 `source` 字段中标注取自哪几道参考题（写编号）的什么机制、变异点或新组合点在哪。允许单个机制与某道参考题相同，但组合后的整体推理路径必须是新的。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
- `source`：取自参考题 X、Y 的什么机制，变异点/新组合点是什么。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式，但注意描述需正确且符合该对象作用，例如箭头需要有指向性，至少为三像素。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 每一层的难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   本轮每道新题都必须是真多层。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加层"是劣解，伪多层视为不合格**。
10. 在符合 ARC 题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励三层或四层结构，但不可为了层数违背要求。层与层之间应有依赖——前一层归纳的产物是后一层变换的输入，而不是两条互不相关的规则简单拼在一起。
11. 警惕**层塌缩**：每一层的判断依据应与被变换的对象分离（位于网格的其他位置，或来自跨对象的全局关系）。如果解题者对任意单个对象做一次输入输出对比，就能同时读出所有层的规则（例如线索就写在被变换对象自己身上），那么无论描述里写了几步，该题实际只有一层。

生成后对生成的题执行以下五项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性与取材
  单个机制允许与参考题相同，但新题的整体机制组合与核心推理路径不得与任何一道参考题相同，也不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。同时核对 `source` 字段：每道题都标注了来源参考题，且取材与变异点描述属实。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30）。逐题清点描述中出现的所有颜色名：必须全部来自注意事项 5 的清单（清单之外的颜色名一律不可用），且含背景在内总数不超过 10 种。规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
5. 层级审查
  逐题逐层检查：每一层是否都需要解题者主动归纳？若某一层肉眼一扫即得，该题为伪多层，必须加深该层或重写整题。再按注意事项 11 检查层塌缩：一次输入输出对比是否会同时暴露所有层（若是则不合格）。最后核对全批中三层及以上的题目是否达到 2 道。
