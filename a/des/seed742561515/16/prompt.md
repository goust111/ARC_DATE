Extend row bars periodically across the opposite side of a separator column.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A near-solid vertical separator divides the grid into two sides.
- One side contains horizontal colored bars; the other side is blank target space.
- Bars may be stacked by row and may sit at different distances from the separator.

Rule:
- Identify the separator as the column whose non-bg cells are one color.
- Treat the denser side as the bar side and collect each contiguous row run.
- Process bars from nearest to farthest from the separator; for each bar, paint its
  color every bar-length cells into the blank side without overwriting earlier paint.

Key insight: Each bar's length is the period for its extension, and nearer bars claim target cells first.

Move every foreground object straight downward by a number of rows equal to its own pixel count.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- The foreground is made of separated 4-connected monochromatic objects.
- Objects may move partly below the bottom edge of the grid.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- For each foreground object, compute its area in pixels.
- Redraw the object at the same columns and that many rows lower, clipping pixels below the grid.

Key insight:
- The downward displacement is the object's own area; color and shape only identify which pixels move together.

Slide each inner colored object horizontally into the same-colored vertical wall until it touches an obstacle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are two non-background colors.
- One foreground color fills the left column and the other fills the right column.
- Extra 8-connected objects of each wall color appear away from that color's wall.

Rule
- Clear the extra objects from their original positions.
- For each wall color, process its 8-connected extra objects from nearest to farthest from the matching wall.
- Slide each object horizontally toward its matching wall as far as possible without overlapping the wall or an already settled object of the same color.
- Keep the two vertical wall columns fixed.

Key insight
- The side columns act like color-specific gravity walls: same-colored objects compact sideways against their own wall while preserving each object's shape.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

<description>
Convert each hollow 3x3 symbol to one pixel and slide the pixels clockwise from the marked edge.

Input structure
- The grid has a background, one full-edge marker line, and monochrome hollow 3x3 foreground symbols.
- The symbols lie on a coarse row/column lattice; fully empty lattice rows or columns are absent from the output.

Rule
- Replace each hollow 3x3 symbol with one pixel of its color in the corresponding coarse-grid cell.
- The marker edge gives the compaction direction by clockwise border travel: top -> right, right -> down, bottom -> left, left -> up.
- Preserve the order of non-background pixels while sliding them as far as possible in that direction.

Key insight
- The large picture is a scaled symbolic grid, and the blue edge marker acts as a gravity direction rather than as output content.

Match sprites to frames by connected-hole count, then nest each sprite inside its frame.

Input structure:
- bg = azure (8). Large hollow squares (frames) arranged in a grid; smaller filled squares (sprites) placed elsewhere.
- Each frame and sprite has a distinct color. Sprites may contain holes (non-sprite-color pixels).

Rule:
- Frames form a regular grid; some may be bg-colored (invisible).
- Count connected hole regions inside each frame's interior and each sprite.
- Pair each frame with the sprite sharing the same hole count.
- Place the matched sprite inside the frame border; recolor sprite holes to the frame's color.

Key insight: The matching key is the number of connected hole components, not hole area or color.

Simulate tokens falling through a pipe network after gates rotate open.

Input structure:
- Wall (0), bg (pipe fill), gate (horizontal 1×3 bars), token (small edge pixels).

Rule:
- Rotate each gate into a vertical blocker; gate cells become bg.
- Tokens drop downward through bg, choosing the extreme column for their side (left→min, right→max).
- Tokens settle at true pipe ends (adjacent to wall/boundary), packing inward.

Key insight: Tokens select drop columns by entry side and land at wall-bounded endpoints, ignoring blocker-bounded ones.

<description>
Untangle overlapping colored rectangular frames into concentric square frames ordered by their visible crossings.

Input structure
- The background contains several one-cell-thick axis-aligned rectangular frames, one color per frame.
- Frames overlap, and the visible color at an overlap records a directed crossing from the hidden frame to the visible frame.
- Each foreground color still has visible pixels on the perimeter of its full rectangular bounding box.

Rule
- Infer each color's full rectangular frame from the bounding box of its visible pixels.
- Add a directed edge A -> B when B is visible at a crossing of A and B's frame perimeters.
- Find the unique path that visits every frame color once, then render those colors as one-pixel-thick concentric square frames from outside to inside.

Key insight
- The output is not a crop of the input; the crossing graph gives a single frame order, and that order is redrawn as nested rings.

Dock two-tone sprites into color-matched horizontal bars with a color swap.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top area: small two-tone sprites (outer color + inner color).
- Below: horizontal bars spanning most of the row, each with a fill color and border color on edges.

Rule:
- Match each sprite to the bar whose fill color equals the sprite's outer color.
- Place the sprite at its original x-position, aligned to the bar's bottom.
- Recolor: sprite outer → bar border, sprite inner → bar fill.
- Erase original sprites from the top area.

Key insight: Color matching is inverted — the sprite's dominant color identifies its target bar, then gets swapped to the bar's accent color.

Select the majority interior marker color, then redraw the framed board as that color's frame plus its bounding-box outline.

Input structure:
- The top row is a copied palette made from adjacent equal color pairs.
- Below it is a one-cell-thick rectangular frame around a black interior.
- Non-black, non-frame interior pixels are marker colors; one marker color has
  the unique highest count.

Rule:
- Keep the palette row unchanged.
- Pick the uniquely most frequent interior marker color.
- Clear the lower board to black, recolor its outer frame with the picked color,
  and draw the picked color's interior bounding-box border.

Key insight:
- The noisy marker cloud is not preserved as pixels; only the majority marker
  color and its spatial extent define the output.

Stamp recolored sprites into a framed region using placeholder positions and a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg background, a rectangular single-color frame, colored placeholder cells inside the frame.
- Outside the frame: sprite shapes (one per placeholder color) and a small legend mapping each placeholder color to an output color.

Rule:
- Find the frame and its interior placeholders.
- For each placeholder color, locate the matching-color sprite outside the frame.
- Stamp each sprite at the placeholder's position inside the frame.
- Recolor every stamped sprite to the output color defined by the legend.

Key insight: The legend pairs (overlapping two-color glyphs outside the frame) dictate the final recoloring — placeholder color selects the shape, legend maps it to the output color.

Repeat the bottom foreground motif upward until it fills the whole grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground pixels occupy a contiguous block of rows at the bottom.
- That bottom block is the complete vertical motif, including its background cells.

Rule
- Copy the bottom motif rows repeatedly upward across the full grid.
- Preserve horizontal alignment and vertical phase: the original first motif row remains at its input row.
- The output shape is unchanged.

Key insight
The blank rows above the bottom foreground block are missing repetitions of the same row motif, not empty space.

Complete outlined shapes and carry attached shadow pixels along their edges.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Each active color marks vertices of an 8-direction aligned outline.
- A start vertex can have adjacent non-bg, different-colored shadow pixels.
- Other colored pixels may be distractors unless they lie on valid drawable edges.

Rule:
- For each color, order its pixels by polar angle around their centroid to form a cycle.
- Draw only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree edges whose interiors are clear.
- From the chosen start vertex, copy adjacent shadow offsets along each drawable edge
  when the parallel path is in bounds and clear.

Key insight: The main outline is reconstructed first, then the start vertex's neighbor offsets define parallel shadow strokes.

Build a four-quadrant rotational tiling of the input square.

Input structure
- The input is a square grid treated as one complete sprite.

Rule
- Each output quadrant is a 2x2 repetition of a rotated copy of the whole input.
- The quadrant rotations are upper-left 180 degrees, upper-right 90 degrees
  clockwise, lower-left 90 degrees counterclockwise, and lower-right unchanged.

Key insight
- The output is a 4x4 grid of original-size blocks, not a per-pixel scale-up.

Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

Erase each target-color object crossed by the ray pointed by the bar-and-control marker.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is one three-pixel straight marker bar and one singleton control pixel adjacent to the bar center.
- The remaining non-background color forms multiple 4-connected target objects.

Rule:
- Cast a straight ray from the marker bar center in the direction away from the adjacent control pixel.
- Find every 4-connected target-color object that intersects that ray.
- Recolor all pixels of those hit target objects to the background; all other pixels stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- The whole object is erased when the center ray touches any of its pixels; the full marker bar width is not swept.

Fill every lattice slot from the color assigned to that slot position by the other lattices.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The largest foreground color forms several one-pixel-thick rectangular lattice frames.
- The frame lines divide each lattice into the same row-by-column set of rectangular slots; some slots already contain one non-frame color.

Rule:
- Infer a color for each logical slot position from the colored slots across all lattice frames.
- Repaint every slot interior in every lattice with the inferred color for its row/column position.
- Keep the frame lines and all background outside frames unchanged.

Key insight:
- Slot sizes vary by frame, but the complete color pattern is indexed by lattice slot position rather than by absolute pixel size or location.

Erase the top palette row and redraw it below as a widening wedge centered on its missing cell.

Input structure
- The top row is a palette row with exactly one background gap.
- Below it, the only foreground is one vertical marker bar of a single color.
- The marker bar is either in the gap column or immediately beside it.

Rule
- Clear the grid to background.
- Starting at the top of the marker bar, each next row copies one more
  column of the top-row palette on both sides of the gap.
- Fill the gap column with the marker color, and keep the vertical marker bar.

Key insight
- The lone background cell in the top row is the center of the expanding
  copy; the lower vertical bar provides the center color and the row where
  the expansion begins.

Draw the missing diagonal connector segment between each pair of same-color rectangular objects.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground color appears as exactly two separated solid rectangular 4-connected objects.
- The two rectangles of each color are diagonally offset with facing corners on a 45-degree line.

Rule:
- Keep all existing rectangles unchanged.
- For each foreground color, connect the lower facing corner of the upper rectangle to the upper facing corner of the lower rectangle.
- Paint only the intervening background pixels on that diagonal, excluding the two endpoint pixels already in the rectangles.

Key insight:
- Same-color rectangles define the endpoints; the output completes the open diagonal between their nearest facing corners.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
