Summarize the enclosed table slots by the single object color inside each slot, using the slot background color for empty slots.

Input structure
- The most common color forms the outer background and all enclosed slot
  backgrounds.
- The enclosed background components form a complete rectangular array of
  slots, ordered by their positions.
- Each slot contains either no other color or exactly one object color.

Rule
- Find all 4-connected components of the most common color that do not touch
  the input edge.
- Sort their bounding boxes into row and column order to define the output
  table.
- For each slot, output its unique non-background color if present; otherwise
  output the background color.

Key insight
- The large grid is an expanded table: the enclosed background components are
  the cells, and any colored object drawn inside a cell is that cell's summary
  value.

Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

Rotate each magenta source pixel 90 degrees counterclockwise around its matched blue pivot, recoloring the new pixel orange.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are blue pivot pixels and magenta source pixels.
- Each magenta source can be paired one-to-one with a blue pivot in the same
  row or column.

Rule:
- Remove all magenta source pixels.
- For each matched source/pivot pair, preserve the source distance from the
  pivot but rotate its offset 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Paint the rotated in-bounds target orange; if the target is outside the
  grid, the source simply disappears.

Key insight:
The blue pixels are rotation centers, and row/column alignment gives a
unique global matching from each magenta source to its pivot.

Build a four-quadrant rotational tiling of the input square.

Input structure
- The input is a square grid treated as one complete sprite.

Rule
- Each output quadrant is a 2x2 repetition of a rotated copy of the whole input.
- The quadrant rotations are upper-left 180 degrees, upper-right 90 degrees
  clockwise, lower-left 90 degrees counterclockwise, and lower-right unchanged.

Key insight
- The output is a 4x4 grid of original-size blocks, not a per-pixel scale-up.

Mark every complete square object with red pixels just outside its corners.

Input structure:
- A uniform background contains one or more monochrome 4-connected foreground objects.
- The relevant objects are square frames or filled squares: their bbox is square
  and all cells on the bbox border have the object's color.
- Non-square bars and incomplete fragments may also appear and are ignored.

Rule:
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For each complete square object, paint red on the two outside background
  pixels orthogonally adjacent to each of the square's four corners.

Key insight: The transformation is not based on size or color; it selects
objects whose bounding box is a complete square border and labels only their
exposed outer corner-adjacent cells.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Mark the center of each odd-sized solid square with the plus marker color, erasing the marker only when it is outside the marked-center field.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: one unique 3x3 plus marker and one color forming separated solid square objects.

Rule:
- For every non-marker 4-connected object, assert it is a solid square.
- If the square side length is odd, recolor its center pixel to the plus marker color; even-sided squares stay unchanged.
- Preserve the plus marker when its center lies inside the bounding box of the odd-square centers; otherwise erase it to background.

Key insight:
- Odd-sided solid squares have a single visible center pixel, and the plus supplies the color used to identify those centers.

Move the yellow 3x3 frame by the displacement encoded by the gray path, then draw its diagonal yellow corner rays.

Input structure:
- The background is black.
- One 3x3 yellow frame has a non-yellow control-color center.
- A second control-color pixel is connected through gray path pixels to a lone yellow endpoint.

Rule:
- Use the vector from the second control-color pixel to the lone yellow endpoint as the frame's translation.
- Fill the whole output with the control color.
- Draw the translated yellow frame and extend yellow diagonal rays outward from its four corners to the grid edge.

Key insight: The gray path's turns are irrelevant; its two colored endpoints encode the net displacement to apply to the frame.

Recolor each side-marked multicolor object embedded in a monochrome panel to its marker color.

Input structure:
- Same-color 4-connected components form monochrome panel regions.
- The bounding box of a panel may contain 4-connected non-panel-color objects.
- A target object touches exactly one side of its panel bbox, and all of its
  pixels on that side have one marker color.

Rule:
- For every target object, fill any panel-colored holes enclosed by the object.
- Recolor the object and filled holes to the side marker color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- A multicolor object's single contact side identifies both which object should
  be normalized and which color should replace it.

Advance short marker bars away from the full edge bar, turning completed two-pixel markers into edge-color marks at the opposite side.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a complete one-cell-thick bar on exactly one outer edge.
- The other foreground color appears only in the first two cells inward from that bar, lane by lane.

Rule
- In each lane perpendicular to the edge bar, a one-pixel marker adjacent to the bar grows one more cell inward.
- A two-pixel marker in those first two inward cells is cleared back to background.
- The cleared two-pixel marker is replaced by a two-pixel mark of the edge-bar color at the opposite side of the same lane.

Key insight
- The full edge bar defines both the orientation and the direction of the local two-step marker cycle.

Recolor the large mask crop column-by-column using the separate three-row palette strip.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- One large monochrome foreground object is the mask; its bbox is the output region and may contain background holes.
- The remaining foreground is a 3-row palette rectangle with the same width as the mask bbox: two identical color rows and one uniform row.

Rule:
- Crop to the mask object's bbox.
- For each output column, color mask pixels with the corresponding color from the repeated palette rows.
- Replace background holes inside the crop with the palette's uniform third-row color.

Key insight:
The grey object is only a stencil; its columns select colors from the legend, while its holes expose the legend's fill color.

Sort vertical bars by height and redistribute them across fixed colored slots.

Input structure:
- bg background; a horizontal base line of a single color spans the full grid width.
- Several monochrome vertical bars of distinct colors rise upward from the base line.

Rule:
- Rank bar shapes by height (shortest to tallest).
- Rank original x-positions (slots) left to right.
- Place the i-th shortest shape into the i-th leftmost slot, recoloring it to that slot's original color.
- The base line is preserved unchanged.

Key insight: Each slot keeps its x-position and color identity; only the bar silhouettes are redistributed among slots by height order.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Recolor the small defect bars on each shared-color object with the opposite panel color.

Input structure
- The grid contains two large panel colors and one shared object color.
- Each shared-color object is a mostly solid rectangle inside exactly one panel.
Rule
- Find the near-solid rectangular core of each object.
- Missing core pixels and one-cell protrusions define two-pixel bars perpendicular to the nearest core edge.
- Recolor those bars with the other panel color; leave all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The colors to add are not tied to numeric ids: each object's surrounding panel identifies the opposite panel color.

Fold each straight red rod at its black marker, leaving the gray-anchored side fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground object is a straight horizontal or vertical 4-connected rod.
- Each rod contains many pixels of one line color, one endpoint marker, and one
  interior control marker.

Rule:
- For every rod, keep the segment from the endpoint marker through the control
  marker unchanged.
- Move the line-color tail on the far side of the control marker to a
  perpendicular ray starting next to that marker.
- Choose the perpendicular direction with more space to the grid edge.

Key insight:
- The endpoint marker identifies the fixed side of the rod, while the control
  marker is the hinge; the tail folds into the larger open half-plane.

Shift each interior pixel whose color matches a frame side one cell toward that matching side.

Input structure
The grid has a one-cell-thick rectangular frame: the four corners are the
background color, and each side between corners is a solid, distinct side
color. The interior is mostly background with sparse foreground pixels.

Rule
Interior pixels with the top-side color move one row up, bottom-side color
move one row down, left-side color move one column left, and right-side color
move one column right. A pixel already adjacent to its matching side stays in
place; colors that do not match a frame side and the frame itself are unchanged.

Key insight
The colored frame sides act as direction labels for matching interior pixels.

Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Move each marked L-shaped sprite onto the separate pixel matching its marker color.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground has 4-connected multicolor sprites and isolated one-pixel controls.
- Each sprite has one repeated body color in an L shape plus one embedded marker
  pixel of a different color.

Rule
- If the embedded marker color also appears as a separate isolated control pixel,
  translate the whole sprite so the body L-bend lands on that control pixel.
- Clear each moved sprite from its old position, clear its consumed control pixel,
  then paste all translated sprites; sprites without a matching control stay put.

Key insight
- The marker color pairs a sprite with its destination control, while the L-bend
  gives the orientation-independent anchor cell to place on that destination.

Shift each row's dominant middle-color run left until its right edge aligns with the leftmost original right edge, moving displaced left-side pixels after the run.

Input structure:
- The grid has three colors.
- The most common color forms one contiguous horizontal run in every row.
- Pixels before those runs share one side color, and pixels after those runs share the other side color.

Rule:
- Find the minimum right edge column among the middle-color runs.
- In each row, keep the run width and the trailing right-side color count.
- Place the middle-color run so its right edge is at that minimum column, unless the run is too wide, in which case start it at column 0.
- Fill any remaining non-trailing cells with the left-side color.

Key insight:
The varying row prefixes are movable padding; the stable feature is the leftmost right boundary of the middle-color shape.

Expand the colored runs from the left reference panel into the blank right panel.

Input structure:
- A uniform rectangular frame surrounds the grid.
- One full-height divider of the frame color splits a left reference panel
  from a blank right panel.
- Both panels have one background margin column on each side of their active
  columns; the left active columns contain two-column endpoint slots, possibly
  connected by same-color horizontal runs.

Rule:
- Keep the original grid and paint only in the right panel's active columns.
- A source run exactly matching the left endpoint slot is copied to the left
  two columns of the right active span.
- A source run exactly matching the right endpoint slot is copied to the right
  two columns of the right active span.
- A source run connecting the endpoint slots is stretched across the entire
  right active span.

Key insight:
The left panel is a compressed legend for the right panel: endpoint markers
stay two pixels wide, while connectors between endpoints expand to fill the
distance between them.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
