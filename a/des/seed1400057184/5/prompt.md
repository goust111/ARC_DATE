Select the majority interior marker color, then redraw the framed board as that color's frame plus its bounding-box outline.

Input structure:
- The top row is a copied palette made from adjacent equal color pairs.
- Below it is a one-cell-thick rectangular frame around a black interior.
- Non-black, non-frame interior pixels are marker colors; one marker color has
  the unique highest count.

Rule:
- Keep the palette row unchanged.
- Pick the uniquely most frequent interior marker color.
- Clear the lower board to black, recolor its outer frame with the picked color,
  and draw the picked color's interior bounding-box border.

Key insight:
- The noisy marker cloud is not preserved as pixels; only the majority marker
  color and its spatial extent define the output.

Recolor the large mask crop column-by-column using the separate three-row palette strip.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- One large monochrome foreground object is the mask; its bbox is the output region and may contain background holes.
- The remaining foreground is a 3-row palette rectangle with the same width as the mask bbox: two identical color rows and one uniform row.

Rule:
- Crop to the mask object's bbox.
- For each output column, color mask pixels with the corresponding color from the repeated palette rows.
- Replace background holes inside the crop with the palette's uniform third-row color.

Key insight:
The grey object is only a stencil; its columns select colors from the legend, while its holes expose the legend's fill color.

Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

Complete partial paths inside a framed rectangle by projecting external color traces inward.

Input structure:
- bg, a 1px rectangular frame (border color) with uniform interior fill.
- Colored components outside the frame touching its edges.

Rule:
- Output = the frame's interior, filled with the fill color.
- Map each outside component's frame-touch points into interior coordinates.
- Monochrome components become solid Manhattan stripes between mapped endpoints.
- Two-color components become alternating-color Manhattan paths.

Key insight: Endpoint colors of two-color traces anchor the alternating phase deterministically.

Move the single marker to the endpoint reached by sliding along the obstacle contour.

Input structure:
- A dominant background color fills the canvas.
- One single-pixel marker sits away from a connected obstacle region of the
  remaining color.
- The marker has exactly one horizontal or vertical sightline to the obstacle.

Rule:
- Find the last background pixel before the obstacle along that sightline.
- From that pixel, try the two diagonal turns that continue around the
  obstacle boundary.
- Move the marker to the endpoint of the turn that remains 4-adjacent to the
  obstacle for the longest distance.

Key insight:
The marker is not placed by distance to the obstacle; it first points to the
obstacle, then follows the visible outside contour until that contour segment ends.

Copy the unique colored sprite tile into every tiled cell marked by an internal separator-colored pixel.

Input structure
- Full same-color separator rows and columns partition the grid into equal rectangular tiles.
- One tile contains the only non-background, non-separator colored sprite.
- Target tiles are otherwise background-colored but contain at least one internal pixel of the separator color.

Rule
- Keep the separator lines and the source sprite tile unchanged.
- Replace each marked target tile with an exact copy of the source tile.
- Unmarked background-only tiles remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The internal separator-colored pixels are placement markers; the single colored tile is the template to stamp into those marked cells.

Return the ring object reached by following the guide path from the checkerboard object.

Input structure
- The input has one dominant background color, one 3x3 checkerboard object,
  several 3x3 ring objects, and sparse guide pixels on a two-cell lattice.

Rule
- Find the checkerboard object and its unique adjacent guide pixel.
- Follow guide pixels of that color through two-cell horizontal/vertical steps.
- Output the unique 3x3 ring object adjacent to that connected guide path.

Key insight
- The checkerboard object is the source, and the color of its attached guide
  pixel selects the path whose far endpoint points at the answer ring.

<description>
Move the repeated boundary color's rectangles one block inward while leaving singleton boundary rectangles in place.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Foreground objects are solid monochrome rectangles touching a grid corner.
- Exactly one foreground color appears as multiple separate 4-connected objects; other colors appear once.

Rule:
- Clear the multiple objects of the repeated color from their original positions.
- For each cleared rectangle, translate it away from the row and column border it touches by exactly its height and width.
- Keep singleton-color objects unchanged; overlapping translated rectangles of the same color merge.

Key insight:
- Multiplicity selects the moving color, and each boundary rectangle's touched edges determine its inward diagonal translation.

Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

Stamp source sprites into a destination frame via color-matched singleton markers.

Input structure:
- Two bordered rectangles: source (multi-cell sprites) and destination (singleton markers).
- Each sprite has an anchor pixel — its least-frequent color. Markers share these colors.

Rule:
- Match each destination marker to the source sprite with the same anchor color.
- Translate the sprite so its anchor overlaps the marker position.
- Output is the destination rectangle, interior cleared before stamping.

Key insight: The rarest color per sprite doubles as a template key and positioning anchor.

<description>
Fill the parallelogram-shaped region between parallel anti-diagonal line segments with red.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One non-bg color forms short diagonal segments, each lying on a single anti-diagonal (r+c = const).
- Segments come in parallel pairs bounding a region to be filled.

Rule:
- For each main-diagonal axis (r−c = const), collect anti-diagonal segments whose span covers that axis.
- Sort those segments by their anti-diagonal index (r+c).
- Fill all bg cells lying strictly between consecutive segment pairs along that axis with red (color 2).

Key insight: The two diagonal directions decouple — segments sit on anti-diagonals, and filling sweeps along main diagonals between them, forming parallelogram regions.

Reorder and stack rectangles by proximity to two colored edge lines.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two edge lines (h + v) meet at a corner marked by a unique color.
- "Blue" line is color 1 if present, else the longer line; other is "red."
- Solid rectangles in the interior.

Rule:
- Sort rectangles by (distance to blue edge, distance to red edge).
- If the blue edge is vertical, rotate each rectangle 90° CCW.
- Stack top-to-bottom, centered horizontally.

Key insight: Edge-line colors encode a coordinate system; proximity to each axis determines stacking order and rotation.

Repair noisy periodic patterns inside frame-delimited grid regions.

Input structure:
- Frame color (most common) forms full rows/cols, dividing the grid into rectangular regions.
- bg (second most common) fills empty space; each region contains a small colored tile repeated periodically with a few corrupted pixels.

Rule:
- For each region, find the bounding box of non-bg content.
- Infer the smallest repeating tile that explains the pattern (majority vote per residue position), requiring it repeat at least 2x per axis.
- Replace the region with the clean tiled version.

Key insight: Tile dimensions are unknown and must be inferred; prefer the smallest tile with genuine repetition over one that memorizes the entire region.

<description>
Replace an orange canvas with concentric Manhattan-distance color rings centered on the lone marker pixel.

Input structure:
- The grid is an orange background with exactly one non-orange marker pixel.
- The marker color is one of the colors in the fixed non-orange ring cycle.

Rule:
- The marker location is distance 0 and keeps the marker color.
- Each step of Manhattan distance away from the marker advances one position
  through the cycle green, yellow, black, grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, blue.
- Fill every pixel of the original grid by this distance-indexed cycle.

Key insight: The output is not copied from existing objects; it is the
distance field around the single marker, colored by a cyclic palette that
excludes the orange background.

Red diamond outlines contract by one layer and gray diamond outlines expand by one layer while other objects stay fixed.

Input structure
- A 16x16 orange-background grid contains one-cell-thick Manhattan-diamond outlines.
- Red and gray outlines are the changing objects; other colored diamond outlines are static.
- Some outlines may be clipped by the grid boundary, but their visible pixels still fit a clipped Manhattan-distance contour.
Rule
- Clear all red and gray pixels.
- Red objects are redrawn with the same diamond center and radius minus one.
- Gray objects are redrawn with radius plus one; an ambiguous edge-clipped growing arc continues away from the nearest perpendicular edge.
Key insight
- The task is not about moving whole objects: each changing object is a contour of a diamond, and the visible operation is one step of contour contraction or expansion.

Move the diagonal foreground segment to the next longer run along the same up-right diagonal.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and one foreground color. The foreground pixels form a
contiguous one-pixel-wide segment on a single anti-diagonal.

Rule
Erase the current segment. If its columns are c0..c1 and its length is L, draw the same
color on columns c1+1..c1+L+1 along the same anti-diagonal.

Key insight
The segment advances past its current upper-right end by one whole segment position, and
the next segment is one pixel longer than the current one.

Decode the colored slot map inside the marked motif and rebuild the motif lattice with those colors.

Input structure:
- A blank background surrounds a rectangular lattice of identical motifs.
- The motif rows and columns are separated by one background line.
- One motif has colored marker pixels in its internal odd-row/odd-column slots.

Rule:
- The motif size is 2R+1 by 2C+1, where R by C is the motif lattice size.
- Read the marked motif's odd internal slots as the color map for the R by C output motifs.
- Slots that still contain the repeated motif color map to that repeated motif color.
- Rebuild the compact lattice on a canvas filled with the repeated motif color,
  painting each motif mask with its decoded color.

Key insight:
- The holes and filled odd slots inside one motif are a miniature legend for recoloring the entire repeated motif lattice.

Sort objects to top or bottom edge by whether their shape (up to rotation/flip) is shared.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several multicolor connected components (8-connected) scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Compute each object's canonical shape (binary mask, invariant to rotation and flip).
- Objects whose shape appears in two or more components → translate to TOP edge (row 0).
- Objects whose shape is unique → translate to BOTTOM edge (row H−h).
- Horizontal position (left column) is preserved; only vertical translation changes.

Key insight: The sorting criterion is shape frequency (rotation-invariant), not area — duplicated shapes go up, unique shapes go down.

Normalize vertical two-color bars between paired marker columns around the marker rows.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- A row of red marker pixels sits directly above a row of gray marker pixels
  in the same alternating columns.
- The columns between adjacent markers contain vertical bars made from a
  contiguous teal run above a contiguous blue run.

Rule
- Keep the marker pixels and all non-bar background cells fixed.
- Let h be the maximum teal-run height among the bar columns; paint teal in
  every bar column for h rows ending at the red marker row.
- In each bar column, move its blue run to start at the gray marker row and
  fill all lower cells in that column with maroon.

Key insight
- The marker rows are a baseline: teal is normalized into a common upper
  band, while each blue run keeps its own height below the baseline.

Drop the columns of the top marker downward, stopping blue-ended columns on grey obstacles and letting maroon-ended columns pass to the bottom.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The most numerous non-background color forms stationary grey obstacle pixels.
- The other two colors form a single 3x3 top-edge marker whose top two rows
  are maroon and whose bottom row contains maroon or blue control pixels.

Rule
- Erase the top marker.
- Treat each marker column as a vertical drop retaining its three colors.
- A column whose bottom control pixel is blue stops immediately above the
  first grey pixel below that column, or bottom-aligns if none exists.
- Contiguous maroon-ended columns pass through obstacles and bottom-align;
  if such a run has a clear down-right slide from a grey ledge, shift the
  run one column right before bottom-aligning.
- When a maroon-ended drop lands through a grey bar on the bottom edge, clear
  the rest of the marker-width gap in that bottom bar.

Key insight
- The bottom row of the top marker is a control strip: blue cells mean
  "stick to the first obstacle," while maroon cells mean "fall through."

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
