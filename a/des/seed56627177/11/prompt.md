Fill partitioned regions with concentric colored bands derived from marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Grid partitioned into regions by wall-colored lines.
- Each region has a dominant base color and a few isolated marker pixels of other colors at varying depths from the region boundary.

Rule:
- For each region, read marker colors ordered by their Chebyshev distance from the boundary to build a color palette.
- If no marker sits on the boundary itself, the base color leads the palette.
- Paint every cell with palette[distance mod palette_length], producing repeating concentric rectangular frames that radiate inward.

Key insight: Each marker's depth from the boundary defines its position in the cyclic palette; the pattern then tiles inward automatically.

Paint straight rays from colored side markers into the hollow diamond frame until an interior foreground pixel blocks each ray.

Input structure
- The background contains one complete one-pixel-thick diamond frame.
- Colored marker pixels outside the diamond sit on the top, bottom, left, or right side of the frame's bounding box.
- Any non-background, non-frame pixels inside the diamond are blockers that remain unchanged.

Rule
- Each outside marker emits inward perpendicular to its side of the diamond bounding box.
- Along that row or column, paint only background pixels strictly inside the diamond with the marker color.
- Stop a ray when it reaches an existing interior foreground pixel; keep the frame and all original colored pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The diamond frame defines a strict interior, while the side markers are column or row emitters whose color fills the visible interior interval until blocked.

Fill the rectangle from the lone foreground pixel to its nearest grid corner.

Input structure
- The grid is a uniform background field with exactly one foreground pixel.
- The foreground pixel's color is the color used for all added pixels.

Rule
- Find the grid corner with the smallest Manhattan distance to the foreground pixel.
- Recolor every pixel in the inclusive axis-aligned rectangle bounded by that
  corner and the foreground pixel to the foreground color.

Key insight
- The single pixel is one corner of the rectangle; the opposite corner is the
  nearest corner of the whole canvas.

Remove diagonal staircase noise and complete broken straight lines.

Input structure:
- bg = background; one foreground color fg forming axis-aligned lines.
- Some fg pixels form 45° diagonal chains (8-connected but 4-disconnected from lines).

Rule:
- Delete all diagonal-only fg pixels (those with no orthogonal fg neighbor, only diagonal ones).
- Fill short gaps in horizontal/vertical lines where a deleted diagonal was nearby.
- Prune remaining diagonal-adjacent leaf pixels near former diagonal sites.

Key insight: Diagonal pixels are hints marking where a straight line is broken; their span sets the maximum gap size to fill.

Move the yellow 3x3 frame by the displacement encoded by the gray path, then draw its diagonal yellow corner rays.

Input structure:
- The background is black.
- One 3x3 yellow frame has a non-yellow control-color center.
- A second control-color pixel is connected through gray path pixels to a lone yellow endpoint.

Rule:
- Use the vector from the second control-color pixel to the lone yellow endpoint as the frame's translation.
- Fill the whole output with the control color.
- Draw the translated yellow frame and extend yellow diagonal rays outward from its four corners to the grid edge.

Key insight: The gray path's turns are irrelevant; its two colored endpoints encode the net displacement to apply to the frame.

Rotate every foreground bar 90 degrees around its own center on the same canvas.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and all foreground pixels share one color.
Each 4-connected foreground object is a solid one-cell-thick horizontal or vertical
bar with odd length, with single-pixel bars allowed.

Rule
Clear the canvas to the background, then redraw every bar with its midpoint, length,
and color preserved while swapping horizontal and vertical orientation.

Key insight
The bars are independent objects: their centers and lengths identify the output
placement, so no matching, ordering, or global symmetry is needed.

Extract the color of each noisy block in a row/column lattice and mirror the coarse grid horizontally.

Input structure:
- A background surrounds a rectangular lattice of monochrome foreground blocks.
- Consecutive rows in a lattice band share the same set of visible foreground colors.
- Consecutive columns in a lattice band share the same set of visible foreground colors.
- Each row-band/column-band intersection has one foreground color, with possible background holes.

Rule:
- Group non-empty rows and columns into consecutive bands by their foreground color sets.
- Replace each lattice cell by the single foreground color inside that row/column-band intersection.
- Return the resulting coarse color grid with the column order reversed.

Key insight:
- Whole-row and whole-column color sets reveal the hidden lattice even when neighboring cells share a color or contain holes.

<description>
Rebuild the foreground rectangles as a largest-to-smallest lower-left nesting.

Input structure
- A periodic wallpaper background is overlaid by foreground colors that each form a rectangular frame or solid rectangle.
- The largest foreground rectangle is the output frame; smaller foreground rectangles are the objects to nest inside it.
- A frame may be partially hidden by a smaller rectangle, but its visible pixels still determine its bbox.

Rule
- Ignore the wallpaper and crop the result to the largest foreground rectangle's bbox size.
- Sort foreground rectangles by bbox area from largest to smallest.
- Reconstruct each frame or solid rectangle, placing every next smaller rectangle in the lower-left of the current rectangle's usable region.

Key insight
- The scattered background colors are not objects; the meaningful order is the unique descending rectangle size chain, and each step nests into the previous rectangle's lower-left interior.

Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

Advance the marker from one half of a vertical bar to the same half of the next longer bar.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color forms many vertical one-cell-wide bars; the other appears as a single vertical marker segment.
- The marker segment occupies exactly the top or bottom half of its containing vertical bar.
Rule
- Recolor the current marker segment back to the bar color.
- Find the unique all-bar-color vertical bar whose height is two pixels greater than the marked source bar.
- Recolor the same half of that next longer bar to the marker color.
Key insight
- Each bar's total height encodes an ordered size, and the marker advances from a 2k bar to the corresponding 2(k+1) bar while preserving whether it marks the top or bottom half.

Move the source-color pixels into the unique outline interior whose size matches the source count.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color forms 8-connected outline objects with row-wise interior cells.
- The other foreground color supplies a set of source pixels away from the chosen outline.
Rule
- For each possible outline color, compute each 8-connected outline object's
  row-span interior: background pixels strictly between the leftmost and
  rightmost outline pixels on each occupied row.
- Select the unique outline interior whose cell count equals the total
  number of pixels of the other foreground color.
- Erase the source pixels and paint that matched interior with the source color.
Key insight
- The colors are roles, not fixed IDs: the source color is identified by
  counting, and the destination is the outline with a matching interior area.

Recolor the large mask crop column-by-column using the separate three-row palette strip.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- One large monochrome foreground object is the mask; its bbox is the output region and may contain background holes.
- The remaining foreground is a 3-row palette rectangle with the same width as the mask bbox: two identical color rows and one uniform row.

Rule:
- Crop to the mask object's bbox.
- For each output column, color mask pixels with the corresponding color from the repeated palette rows.
- Replace background holes inside the crop with the palette's uniform third-row color.

Key insight:
The grey object is only a stencil; its columns select colors from the legend, while its holes expose the legend's fill color.

Fill every row from the nearest marked horizontal bar, turning bar rows and color-boundary ties into separator rows.

Input structure
- A dominant background fills the grid except for full-width horizontal bars and one vertical marker column.
- Outside the marker column, every row is monochrome: either background or a source bar color.
- Background rows share one marker color in the marker column; source bar rows share the other.

Rule
- Each non-source row takes the color of the nearest source bar, with that row's marker-column pixel set to the source-marker color.
- If a row is exactly midway between nearest bars of different colors, make the whole row the source-marker color.
- Each original source bar row becomes a source-marker row with the marker-column pixel changed to the background-row marker color.

Key insight
- The marked bars are horizontal seeds for a one-dimensional nearest-seed partition over rows; equal-distance rows are separators only when the competing seed colors differ.

Repeat the bottom foreground motif upward until it fills the whole grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground pixels occupy a contiguous block of rows at the bottom.
- That bottom block is the complete vertical motif, including its background cells.

Rule
- Copy the bottom motif rows repeatedly upward across the full grid.
- Preserve horizontal alignment and vertical phase: the original first motif row remains at its input row.
- The output shape is unchanged.

Key insight
The blank rows above the bottom foreground block are missing repetitions of the same row motif, not empty space.

Paint the top-connected middle channel between two orange path components teal.

Input structure
- The background is black.
- One foreground color forms exactly two 4-connected one-pixel-wide path components.
- Optional non-background control pixels may sit in the channel between the two paths.

Rule
- Dilate each path component by one cell in the 8-neighborhood and intersect the two dilations; this gives the one-cell-wide middle channel.
- A control pixel in that channel is a blocker only when its 4-neighbors touch fewer than both path components; otherwise it is part of the channel and is repainted.
- After removing blockers, paint the channel component connected to the top edge teal and keep all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The desired pixels are not found by region filling; they are the geometric overlap of the two paths' one-cell halos, with weakly attached control pixels splitting the channel.

Fill the parallelogram-shaped region between parallel anti-diagonal line segments with red.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One non-bg color forms short diagonal segments, each lying on a single anti-diagonal (r+c = const).
- Segments come in parallel pairs bounding a region to be filled.

Rule:
- For each main-diagonal axis (r−c = const), collect anti-diagonal segments whose span covers that axis.
- Sort those segments by their anti-diagonal index (r+c).
- Fill all bg cells lying strictly between consecutive segment pairs along that axis with red (color 2).

Key insight: The two diagonal directions decouple — segments sit on anti-diagonals, and filling sweeps along main diagonals between them, forming parallelogram regions.

Pack the colored sprites along the bottom edge from smallest to largest.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and several monochrome 4-connected
foreground sprites; a full-grid one-cell frame may surround the scene.

Rule
Remove any full-grid rectangular frame, sort the remaining sprites by pixel
area from smallest to largest, and paste their bounding-box sprites left to
right with each sprite bottom-aligned.

Key insight
The original locations do not determine the final slots; each sprite's area
gives the packing order, while its shape and color are preserved.

Fit a grey bar into a grey frame by aligning projections with colored columns, then stack colors above.

Input structure:
- bg, a grey structural color forming two components: a large rectangular frame (slot) and a smaller bar with upward projections.
- Colored pixels inside the slot mark target columns.

Rule:
- Move the bar upward into the slot so its bottom edge sits one cell above the slot's interior bottom.
- Shift it horizontally so the bar's upward projections align column-wise with the colored pixels in the slot.
- Stack the colored pixels immediately above the bar projections in each column.

Key insight: The bar's projections act as keys that must align with the colored-column "locks" in the slot.

Move each marked cross object away from its marker to the grid edge while rotating the colored cross 180 degrees.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each 8-connected foreground object has nine pixels: a 4-pixel marker-color
  sprite attached to a 5-pixel non-marker colored cross.
- Each object bbox is either 3x6 or 6x3, so the marker sprite is on exactly
  one side of the cross.

Rule:
- Move the whole object straight away from its marker side until the object
  bbox touches the corresponding grid edge.
- Keep the marker sprite unchanged within the object.
- Rotate the 3x3 colored cross block by 180 degrees before placing it.

Key insight:
The marker sprite is a directional tail; the cross is the leading payload,
and only that payload turns around during the slide to the edge.

Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
