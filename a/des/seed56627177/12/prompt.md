Insert red components into interior sockets of large structures, leaving a black trail.

Input structure:
- bg = most common. Large non-bg, non-red structures with interior cavities.
- Red components outside structures.

Rule:
- Interior sockets: bg cells inside a structure's bbox, adjacent to structure pixels.
- For each structure, find the direction where rays from sockets hit a red component.
- Slide that component into the socket; paint traversed cells black.
- Unmatched reds vanish.

Key insight: Docking direction is inferred by ray-casting from interior sockets to the nearest red component.

Reverse the sequence of colors along the single 4-connected foreground path while keeping the path shape fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- All non-background pixels form one multicolor 4-connected one-pixel-wide path.
- The path has exactly two endpoints and no branches.

Rule:
- Walk the path from one endpoint to the other.
- Replace the colors on those same path cells by the original path colors in reverse order.
- Leave every background pixel unchanged.

Key insight:
- Nothing moves geometrically; only the color string written on the path is reversed between the endpoints.

Keep the larger sprite from each separated panel and overlay those sprites into one 5x5 canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a 5x17 grid: three 5x5 panels separated by one-cell black columns.
- Each panel has the same background color and exactly one foreground color split into two 4-connected components.

Rule:
- In each panel, discard the smaller foreground component and keep the unique largest component as the sprite.
- Process panels left to right, placing each sprite at its panel coordinates on a 5x5 background canvas.
- If a sprite would cover an already placed sprite, slide it by the unique nearest in-bounds offset that avoids overlap.

Key insight:
- The extra same-colored component in each panel is a distractor; the final answer is the non-overlapping overlay of the three largest components.

Fill the background under a top-row red/grey span with a shrinking diagonal pattern that alternates red and grey.

Input structure:
- The grid has an orange background.
- All foreground pixels are red or grey and lie on the top row.
- The first and last top-row foreground pixels define an odd-width span.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- For row r below the top, fill columns span_left + r through span_right - r.
- Each filled cell takes the top-row color r columns up-left, flipped red<->grey once per row step.

Key insight:
- The output is the top-row span propagated down-right along diagonals, while the allowable region shrinks inward from both ends each row.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Paint the maze corridor and framed rooms lying on shortest paths between the two colored endpoint components.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one wall color forming thin orthogonal frames, and one endpoint/fill color.
- The endpoint/fill color forms exactly two 4-connected solid rectangular components; their larger side lengths define the framed room sizes.

Rule
- Treat wall pixels as blocked and every other pixel as passable.
- Find every passable pixel that lies on a shortest 4-connected path between the two endpoint components.
- Also fill any framed square room of an endpoint-derived size that intersects that shortest-path mask.

Key insight
- Shortest paths identify the route through open connector corridors, while the wall-bordered square rooms need to be expanded from the route centerline to their full interior.

Move bordered containers toward same-colored destination markers, charging gray cells to orange.

Input structure:
- bg = 6 (magenta). Black-bordered (0) rectangles with gray (5) / orange (7) interiors.
- A head sprite (9) sits adjacent to one container edge; a matching destination sprite lies along the movement axis.

Rule:
- Each container translates toward its destination along the head-to-dest axis.
- Steps = min(head-to-dest distance, number of gray interior cells).
- Gray cells become orange from the head-facing side inward, one per step.

Key insight: Gray cell count caps movement — a container stops short if it runs out of gray cells to charge.

<description>
Copy each marked sprite to every standalone marker of the same color and erase the original sources.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each source is an 8-connected component containing a monochrome sprite and one marker pixel of another color.
- Other isolated marker pixels may be destinations; marker colors with no source sprite are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the grid to background.
- For every source marker color, place the sprite at each other marker of that color using the source marker as the anchor.
- Keep each destination marker pixel in place; do not keep source sprites, source markers, or distractor markers.

Key insight:
- A colored marker is not part of the sprite geometry; it is the anchor that says where same-colored copies of that sprite should be stamped.

Reconstruct the repeated tile from its separated copies and mark the missing pixels in the damaged copy blue.

Input structure:
- The input is a lattice of equal-size blocks separated by one-cell solid rows
  and columns of the same separator color.
- All blocks are copies of one motif except exactly one block, where some
  motif pixels have been overwritten by the motif background color.
- Blue is absent from the input and is reserved as the output marker color.

Rule:
- Recover the motif by taking the unique majority color at each local block
  coordinate across all block copies.
- Find the single block that differs from this consensus motif.
- Return the consensus motif, recoloring the differing local coordinates blue.

Key insight:
- The repeated copies provide redundancy: the damaged positions are exactly
  the coordinates where the lone nonconforming copy has background instead of
  the consensus motif color.

<description>
Move each gray marker along its green path until it reaches the cell next to a black-green-black gate, erasing the path behind it.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground components are made from a path color, a paired gate-end color, and single marker pixels.
- A gate is a straight end-center-end motif whose center has the path color and whose two ends share the gate-end color.

Rule:
- In every 4-connected foreground component with exactly one marker and one gate, erase the marker and all path-color pixels except the gate center.
- Place the marker on the unique path-color pixel adjacent to the gate center but not between the two gate ends.
- Components without both a marker and a gate stay unchanged.

Key insight: The black-green-black motif marks the stopping gate; the gray marker consumes the connected green path until it rests on the path cell immediately beside that gate.

Paint the inner foreground color into every background pixel that touches the enclosing frame only diagonally.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color is an enclosing frame: its bbox strictly contains the bbox of the other, inner color.

Rule:
- Keep all existing pixels unchanged.
- For each background pixel, if it is diagonally adjacent to the frame color and has no orthogonal adjacency to the frame color, recolor it to the inner color.

Key insight: The inner color marks the color to use, while the frame's diagonal-only background neighbors define the cells to add.

Swap each 5x5 sprite with its corner marker color and stamp same-marker composite masks into the matching corner.

Input structure:
- A 30x30 grid has one dominant background color.
- Non-background corner pixels are marker labels.
- Every other foreground color is the body of one 5x5 sprite containing exactly one pixel of a corner marker color.

Rule:
- For each sprite, recolor body pixels to the sprite marker color and recolor the marker pixel back to its body color.
- If a marker lies on the side facing its matching corner and another same-marker sprite has a body pixel at that same local cell, use that visible body color for the marker pixel.
- For each corner marker, overlay the masks of all sprites with that marker color into the corner 5x5 block and paint the visible composite with the marker color.

Key insight:
The corner pixels are labels that group 5x5 sprites by their embedded marker color; each labeled corner shows the grouped sprite silhouette.

Extend a green path from one grid edge to the opposite, routing around red bars at a distance dictated by their blue pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg = azure (8). Red/blue bars (color 2/1) act as obstacles.
- A single green (3) pixel sits on a grid border — the path start.

Rule:
- Each bar's keep-out radius equals its number of blue pixels; the path must stay farther than that from every bar cell.
- The green pixel extends inward toward the opposite edge, turning at right angles to navigate around forbidden zones.
- After the path is drawn, all blue pixels become red.

Key insight: Blue pixels on a bar encode its danger radius — more blue means a wider no-go zone the path must respect.

Add a quantity-color label in the top marker column for each horizontal bar.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background and one non-background marker pixel in the top row.
- Below the marker row, every non-empty source row contains one solid monochrome horizontal bar to the left of the marker column.
- Source rows are staggered every other row.

Rule
- Copy the input grid.
- For each source bar, read its quantity as the bar length.
- Paint the quantity color in the marker column on the same row as the bar:
  2->1, 3->4, 4->9, 5->6.

Key insight
- The grey marker supplies the result column, while each bar supplies a small quantity with a fixed color code.

Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

Recolor grey shapes by matching their hole count to a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; grey (5) sprites scattered across the grid.
- Colored legend shapes (non-bg, non-grey, at least 2×2, not touching the outer border) near grid edge,
  each with a distinct number of enclosed holes.

Rule:
- Each colored legend shape defines a mapping: hole count → color.
- For every grey sprite, count its holes (enclosed bg regions not touching the sprite's bounding-box border).
- Recolor the grey sprite to the matching legend color; erase grey distractors with unlisted hole counts.

Key insight: Shape identity is encoded by topology (number of holes), not geometry or size.

Erase the top palette row and redraw it below as a widening wedge centered on its missing cell.

Input structure
- The top row is a palette row with exactly one background gap.
- Below it, the only foreground is one vertical marker bar of a single color.
- The marker bar is either in the gap column or immediately beside it.

Rule
- Clear the grid to background.
- Starting at the top of the marker bar, each next row copies one more
  column of the top-row palette on both sides of the gap.
- Fill the gap column with the marker color, and keep the vertical marker bar.

Key insight
- The lone background cell in the top row is the center of the expanding
  copy; the lower vertical bar provides the center color and the row where
  the expansion begins.

Fill the small background compartments bounded by the long contour color.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and two foreground colors.
- The more frequent foreground color forms long 8-connected contour fragments.
- The other foreground color is a fixed distractor/obstacle color that partitions
  the background but is never recolored.

Rule:
- Split the background into 4-connected regions using all foreground pixels as
  barriers.
- Keep the two largest background regions as the outside of the contour drawing.
- Recolor every other background region that touches a long contour component
  to the contour color; leave all foreground pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The apparent area fill is exactly a component-level fill of bounded background
compartments, not a row-wise interpolation between individual contour pixels.

Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
