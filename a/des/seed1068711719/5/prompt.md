Convert each hollow 3x3 symbol to one pixel and slide the pixels clockwise from the marked edge.

Input structure
- The grid has a background, one full-edge marker line, and monochrome hollow 3x3 foreground symbols.
- The symbols lie on a coarse row/column lattice; fully empty lattice rows or columns are absent from the output.

Rule
- Replace each hollow 3x3 symbol with one pixel of its color in the corresponding coarse-grid cell.
- The marker edge gives the compaction direction by clockwise border travel: top -> right, right -> down, bottom -> left, left -> up.
- Preserve the order of non-background pixels while sliding them as far as possible in that direction.

Key insight
- The large picture is a scaled symbolic grid, and the blue edge marker acts as a gravity direction rather than as output content.

Turn black dents in two colored regions into marked opposite-color patches.

Input structure:
- Black background with two large foreground colors.
- The large regions contain small black dents and a few one-cell color specks
  or protrusions along region boundaries.

Rule:
- Locally clean the two foreground regions: isolated specks become black, and
  one-cell protrusions surrounded by the other region take that region's color.
- Each original black dent whose cleaned 3x3 neighborhood is mostly one
  foreground color becomes the center of a 3x3 patch in the opposite color.
- The dent center itself is recolored teal (8).

Key insight: The teal pixels mark the original black defects; the surrounding
3x3 patch uses the other foreground color, after first removing boundary noise.

Reorder and stack rectangles by proximity to two colored edge lines.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two edge lines (h + v) meet at a corner marked by a unique color.
- "Blue" line is color 1 if present, else the longer line; other is "red."
- Solid rectangles in the interior.

Rule:
- Sort rectangles by (distance to blue edge, distance to red edge).
- If the blue edge is vertical, rotate each rectangle 90° CCW.
- Stack top-to-bottom, centered horizontally.

Key insight: Edge-line colors encode a coordinate system; proximity to each axis determines stacking order and rotation.

Move magenta particles along corridors formed by parallel colored bars.

Input structure:
- bg=7. Particles=6 in col 0. Colored bars on even rows form corridors on odd rows.

Rule:
- Particle goes straight through bg cells.
- When blocked by a colored cell, turns 90° into the perpendicular direction
  that has a bg cell flanked by same-color bars. Stops at grid edge or full blockage.

Key insight: Same-color parallel bars define the only valid corridors, so each particle follows a deterministic local trace.

Project the framed periodic stripe pattern across the canvas and erase the unused frame cells.

Input structure
- A bg canvas with a one-cell-thick rectangular frame of one color.
- Inside the frame are two parallel full-interior marker bars of another color.
- A third color fills the region between the marker bars on periodically spaced rows or columns.

Rule
- Infer the periodic row or column mask from the third-color stripes inside the frame.
- Paint the frame color along those full rows or columns, extended to the grid boundary.
- Extend the marker bars across the full canvas and repaint the source-color stripe cells between them.

Key insight
- The outer frame is not preserved as a border; it supplies the color for the periodic stripes selected by the inner source pattern.

Keep only the center color and redraw it as a diagonal ray to its indicated corner.

Input structure:
- The grid is an odd square with a unique dominant background color.
- The center pixel is foreground.
- Every off-center pixel with the center color lies in the same diagonal
  quadrant relative to the center.

Rule:
- Fill the whole output with the background color.
- Use the quadrant of the center-colored pixels to choose one diagonal
  direction from the center.
- Draw a continuous line of the center color from the center to the grid
  edge in that direction.

Key insight:
The color at the exact center identifies the surviving color, while the
other pixels of that color identify which corner the center should connect to.

Fill the rectangle from the lone foreground pixel to its nearest grid corner.

Input structure
- The grid is a uniform background field with exactly one foreground pixel.
- The foreground pixel's color is the color used for all added pixels.

Rule
- Find the grid corner with the smallest Manhattan distance to the foreground pixel.
- Recolor every pixel in the inclusive axis-aligned rectangle bounded by that
  corner and the foreground pixel to the foreground color.

Key insight
- The single pixel is one corner of the rectangle; the opposite corner is the
  nearest corner of the whole canvas.

Extend diagonal rays outward from outer-border segments adjacent to diamond shapes on a checkerboard.

Input structure:
- Checkerboard bg (two most common colors).
- Hollow diamond outlines (8-pixel) in a non-bg color (inner border).
- Short diagonal line segments in another non-bg color adjacent to each diamond edge (outer border).

Rule:
- For each outer-border segment, determine the outward direction (perpendicular to the segment, away from the diamond).
- From each endpoint of the segment, cast a diagonal ray outward, painting over bg pixels with the segment's color until hitting a non-bg pixel or the grid edge.

Key insight: Rays emit only from the two endpoints of each outer-border segment, not every pixel, and travel diagonally away from the diamond.

Transfer each colored marker to its adjacent neutral mask component, then erase the markers.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color.
- The neutral mask color is the unique most frequent foreground color.
- Other foreground colors are marker pixels that may touch neutral 4-connected mask components.
Rule
- Remove every marker pixel by recoloring it to the background.
- For each 4-connected neutral mask component, find marker colors touching it by edge adjacency.
- If a component touches one marker color, recolor the whole neutral component to that marker color.
- If a component touches no marker color, leave it neutral.
Key insight
- Marker pixels label neighboring neutral regions but are not part of the final colored objects.

Move each isolated colored pixel into the one-cell frame around a grey 2x2 block.

Input structure:
- Background is the dominant color.
- Grey foreground objects are solid 2x2 anchor blocks.
- Every other non-background, non-grey cell is a colored singleton source.

Rule:
- Keep the grey anchors fixed and clear all colored singleton source pixels.
- For each singleton and each anchor, the normal destination is the cell reached by
  clamping the pixel into the anchor's one-cell outer frame.
- If a diagonally outside singleton has an exact 8-direction sightline into an anchor,
  also allow the cell just before the first grey pixel on that ray.
- Choose distinct destinations that minimize total king-move distance; at equal
  distance prefer exact sightlines, then the shorter Manhattan movement.

Key insight: The grey 2x2 blocks define magnetic frames; conflicts are resolved
structurally by nearest-frame assignment rather than by color identity.

Shift alternating two-color row bars so each row aligns to the topmost bar's color columns.

Input structure:
- The dominant background surrounds horizontal two-pixel bars.
- Every foreground row has exactly one adjacent bar using the same two colors.
- The topmost bar gives the reference left/right column for each color.

Rule:
- Keep bars whose left color is already in its reference column.
- For a reversed bar, shift the whole two-pixel bar horizontally until its
  left color lands in that color's reference column.
- Background cells vacated by shifted bars become background.

Key insight:
- The rows are not recolored; each two-color bar is translated so equal
  colors line up with the topmost reference bar.

Fill holes inside a large template frame using shape-matched outside sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. One large monochrome frame object (template).
- Inside the frame: holes of various shapes (non-frame-color regions).
- Outside the frame: small monochrome sprites scattered on bg.

Rule:
- Crop to the frame's bounding box; fill entirely with frame color.
- For each hole, find an outside sprite whose shape matches (rotation/flip allowed).
- Fill the hole with the matched sprite's color. If multiple sprites match, use the most frequent color.

Key insight: Sprites act as shape-coded color keys — their shape identifies which hole they fill, their color determines the fill color.

Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Paint each pink control pixel as a teal horizontal bar whose reach equals the foreground counts on that row.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one or more pink control pixels.
- Each marker row has exactly one pink pixel; all other non-background pixels
  in that row are counters.
Rule
- Start from an all-background output grid.
- For each pink pixel, count non-background pixels strictly to its left and
  strictly to its right in the same row.
- Paint teal from c - left_count through c + right_count on that row.
Key insight
- The foreground pixels are not copied; only their counts on each side of
  each pink marker encode the teal bar length.

Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

Replace the active black cutout's tail with background and mark the cutout side facing a colored source region.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background, with black rectangle-plus-tail cutouts, one gray source region, and colored distractors.
- Non-gray colored regions and single pixels are distractors/blockers, even when they are multi-pixel staircase shapes.

Rule:
- Find each black cutout whose largest solid rectangle leaves exactly a two-pixel tail.
- The active gray source region is visible only by horizontal rays through background from a cutout's left or right side.
- Select the unique cutout side with the most same-source visible rows, erase that cutout's tail to background, and recolor the full selected vertical side pink (6).

Key insight:
- The colored regions do not move; their horizontal line-of-sight identifies which rectangular cutout is being opened and which side receives the pink mark.

Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

Erase all distractor pixels and expand the single red control pixel into the grid quadrant that contains it.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Exactly one red pixel is the control pixel.
- Other non-background pixels are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Split the grid into equal top/bottom and left/right halves.
- Fill the quadrant containing the red control pixel with red.

Key insight:
- The red control pixel selects a whole half-grid quadrant by its row half and column half; all other foreground pixels are noise.

Expand the top-left seed mask into a recursive colored pattern and tile it across the full grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- All foreground lies in a top-left rectangle whose last row and last column are a solid secondary color.
- Removing that secondary-color row and column leaves a seed region containing background plus one primary color.

Rule
- Use the primary-color pixels in the seed as a binary mask.
- Replace each primary seed cell with a copy of the seed mask in the primary color, and each background seed cell
  with a copy of the seed mask in the secondary color.
- Repeat and crop that expanded tile to the original grid shape.

Key insight
The solid L-shaped secondary-color border is a legend, not output content; it supplies the color used when the
seed's background cells are expanded.

Recolor a path-network by adjacent seed regions.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Path color P forms a thin orthogonal network with a solid square hub (NxN).
- Seed colors appear in colored regions (non-bg, non-P) adjacent to path branches.

Rule:
- Infer P as the non-bg color whose largest component is most network-like.
- Find the largest solid k×k all-P square (the hub); exclude it from recoloring.
- Recolor each path branch to the seed-region color it touches most.
- Recolor the hub center pixel to the seed whose branches touch the hub most.

Key insight: The hub stays uncolored; branches inherit color from adjacent seed regions by adjacency count.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。
11. 可以少出现以下三种类型的创新：查表填充、计数→索引、箭头→方向+距离；多些其他创新组合。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
