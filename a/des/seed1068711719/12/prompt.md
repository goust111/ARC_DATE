Fire projectiles from 3-pixel triangle sprites; mark collisions with maroon or blue.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg 3-pixel sprites shaped as axis-aligned L's or diagonal V's.

Rule:
- Each triangle has an apex and an emission direction determined by its shape: L-shapes fire diagonally away from the missing corner; V-shapes fire along the axis away from the open side.
- A projectile lands exactly 5 cells from the apex in the emission direction.
- If it hits an existing sprite, that entire sprite is recolored to maroon (9).
- If two projectiles land on the same empty cell, that cell becomes blue (1); a lone projectile on empty bg paints maroon (9).

Key insight: The triangle's orientation encodes both direction and target; dual-projectile collisions on open bg produce blue, not maroon.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

Drop the moving-color objects downward until they rest above a one-row cushion before the obstacle or bottom edge.

Input structure:
- The grid has exactly three colors: empty background, a stationary obstacle/floor color, and a moving object color.
- The obstacle color is the unique non-background role that touches the bottom edge.
- Moving pixels start outside the obstacle cells, outside the row directly above each obstacle pixel, and outside the bottom row.

Rule:
- Keep the background and obstacle pixels fixed.
- Treat obstacle pixels, cells directly above obstacle pixels, and the bottom row as blocked.
- Repeatedly move every 4-connected moving-color object one row down when its translated shape does not hit blocked cells or another moving object.

Key insight: The visible floor has an invisible one-row cushion above it, so the objects fall under gravity but stop with one empty row before the floor or the grid bottom.

Stagger the two horizontal input regions onto a larger maroon separator canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a rectangular grid with an even number of rows.
- The top half and bottom half are the two regions to preserve.
- Maroon is absent from the input and is used only as the new separator color.

Rule:
- Create an output with one extra row and one extra column, filled with maroon.
- Copy the top half into the upper-left corner.
- Copy the bottom half one row below the top region and one column to the right.

Key insight:
The output is not a recoloring of either region; it inserts an L-shaped maroon
gap by diagonally offsetting the lower half from the upper half.

Flatten the interior object into a centered line and move the guide bars inward to bracket it.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- One non-background guide color touches the boundary and forms exactly two full parallel bars plus a split perpendicular center bar.
- The other non-background color is a single 8-connected interior object whose area determines the flattened line length.

Rule:
- If the guide pair is vertical, make a vertical object-colored line centered between those bars; otherwise use the analogous horizontal line.
- The line length equals the number of interior object pixels and is centered on the split perpendicular guide bar.
- Rebuild the guide color as the perpendicular center bar plus two full bars immediately beside the flattened object line.

Key insight:
- The guide bars supply only the orientation and center; the interior object's pixel count supplies the length of the final one-cell-thick line.

Recolor the sparse foreground pixels in scan order along their longer spread, cycling red, teal, and grey.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Every foreground object is a single isolated 4-connected pixel.
- The foreground pixel set has a rectangular bbox whose row or column extent defines the scan direction.

Rule:
- Keep the background unchanged.
- If the foreground bbox is at least as tall as it is wide, order foreground pixels row-major; otherwise order them column-major.
- Recolor the ordered pixels by repeating red, teal, grey from the first pixel onward.

Key insight:
- The original foreground colors are only markers; the output color depends on each marker's ordinal position in the dominant scan direction.

Compute a grey result bar by adding teal bar heights and subtracting red bar heights.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several bottom-aligned one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Teal bars are positive operands; red bars are negative operands.
- The penultimate column is an empty result slot.

Rule
- Keep every input bar unchanged.
- Compute result height = total teal bar height - total red bar height.
- Paint that many bottom cells of the penultimate column grey.

Key insight
- The bars encode arithmetic by height, with color providing the sign.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Move every object above the solid bottom stripe upward by its own pixel count.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, exactly one full-width non-background row
that acts as a fixed stripe, and one or more 4-connected monochrome objects
above that stripe.

Rule
Clear each object from its original cells, then translate it straight upward
by the number of pixels in that object, preserving its shape and color. Leave
the full-width stripe unchanged.

Key insight
Each object's area is also its vertical displacement; the full-width row is a
fixed baseline, not a moving object.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Crop the foreground object whose missing cells match marker shapes, and fill those missing cells with the marker colors.

Input structure
A dominant background surrounds several monochromatic foreground objects. Exactly one object has background gaps inside its bounding box whose component shapes are matched by separate marker objects.
Rule
Find that object, crop its bounding box, and replace each background gap component with the color of the separate marker component or components having the same normalized shape.
Key insight
The marker objects do not mark absolute positions; their shapes identify which gaps in the selected object should be colored, while objects with unmatched gaps are distractors.

Complete sparse nested rectangular color layers into solid rectangles.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and every foreground color marks one
axis-aligned rectangular layer; the layer bboxes have unique areas and are
nested from outermost to innermost.
Rule
Take each color's bbox as its completed rectangle, except that a child bbox
which already matches at least three sides of its parent's one-pixel inset
expands to that full inset; repaint the rectangles largest to smallest.
Key insight
The scattered pixels are samples of nested rectangular regions, so the
output is a clean redraw of those regions with inner colors overwriting
outer colors.

Inflate a frame's hole-layout and fill each hole with its matching piece.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Largest component is a monochrome frame enclosing bg holes.
- Outside pieces composed of k×k blocks; k = side of smallest solid square piece.

Rule:
- Extract connected hole regions inside the frame as slots.
- Match each piece to a slot by comparing block-level shapes under rotation/flip.
- Output the layout scaled by k, with pieces placed in slots; frame color as background.

Key insight: Pieces are k×k-block-scaled versions of holes; downsampling reveals shape matches under all 8 orientations.

Move each mirrored bottom source pixel to the far end of its trail and redraw the top half as its reflection.

Input structure
- A solid non-background row separates equal-height top and bottom halves.
- The top half has one marker color on the background.
- In the bottom half, exactly one color has positions that mirror the top markers across the separator, and the other color forms trails touching those source pixels.

Rule
- Identify the bottom source color by reflecting each bottom color into the top half and matching the top marker set.
- For every bottom source pixel, follow its unique 4-connected trail of the other bottom color to the trail endpoint.
- Clear the old top markers, bottom sources, and trails; place the source color at each endpoint and place the top marker color at the reflected endpoint.

Key insight
- The top half is only a mirror display of the bottom moving sources; the actual motion is encoded by the trail attached to each bottom source pixel.

Recolor the grey diagonal-chain regions in an orange field to teal.

Input structure
The input contains only grey pixels and orange pixels.  Grey pixels form
several 8-connected regions embedded in the orange field.

Rule
Decompose each grey 8-connected region into 4-connected lobes.  Recolor the
whole region teal only when it contains a straight diagonal run of at least
three pixels and those lobes meet only by diagonal corner contacts in a
non-branching diagonal chain or cycle; a single 4-connected region is
recolored only when it is a square diagonal staircase.

Key insight
The teal regions are not selected by size or position; they are the grey
regions whose internal connectivity depends on diagonal corner joins, while
same-edge cracks, rectangles, bars, and branching/noisy regions remain grey.

Project maroon markers into adjacent grey or pink 3x3 squares, erasing grey squares afterward.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, solid 3x3 grey and/or pink squares, and maroon marker pixels or segments directly touching one side of exactly one square.
Rule
Grey squares are erased; their adjacent maroon markers stay in place and stamp the nearest edge cell inside the grey square. Pink squares stay pink; their adjacent maroon markers disappear and stamp the corresponding cell on the square's middle row or middle column.
Key insight
The side touched by a marker determines the projection: grey uses the near edge, while pink uses the centerline, preserving the marker's coordinate along that side.

Propagate a repeating striped pattern from a yellow border segment toward the opposite edge, recoloring foreground objects on certain stripes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Foreground blobs of another color scattered in the interior.
- A short yellow (4) segment sits on one border edge.

Rule:
- From the yellow segment, march toward the opposite edge in steps of 2 cells, cycling colors Y, Y, G (4, 4, 3). The 1-cell gap between stripes is forced to bg.
- Yellow stripes paint only within the segment's span.
- Green stripes additionally recolor all non-bg pixels across the entire row/column to green.

Key insight: Green stripes act as a "flood" that recolors existing objects on the full row/column, while yellow stripes are confined to the segment span.

Extend the edge-touching green start bar through the corridor, turning at each teal blocker until the path leaves the grid.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: a 2-pixel 4-connected start bar and many blocker pixels.
- Exactly one pixel of the start bar lies on the grid border.

Rule:
- Start from the border pixel of the bar and move through the other bar pixel into the grid.
- Paint every traversed non-blocker pixel with the start color.
- When the next cell is a blocker, turn to the unique perpendicular non-blocker neighbor; when the next cell is outside the grid, stop.

Key insight: The blocker pixels define a one-cell-wide corridor, so every interior collision has exactly one valid 90-degree turn.

Paint an inner border around the region reachable from a corner marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; wall color (blue) forms barriers dividing the grid.
- A unique single pixel (magenta) sits on one corner — the start marker.
- Some wall-colored pixels are structural (border-touching, enclosing regions); others are decorations.

Rule:
- Flood-fill from the marker corner to find all reachable bg cells, blocked by structural walls.
- Erase wall-colored decorations hidden behind structural walls (not reachable from marker side).
- Paint orange (color 7) on every reachable bg cell adjacent to a wall or grid edge — forming a 1-cell inner border.

Key insight: Only border-connected wall components act as real barriers; interior wall fragments are decorations to be removed.

Clean each color layer by enforcing vertical mirror symmetry.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Several non-bg colors, each forming a nearly-symmetric pattern about some vertical axis.
- Some pixels in each color are "noise" that breaks the symmetry.

Rule:
- For each non-bg color, find the vertical axis that best explains its pixel layout.
- Remove any pixel that lacks a same-color mirror counterpart across that axis.

Key insight: Each color has its own independent symmetry axis; the task is per-color denoising, not whole-grid symmetry.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。
11. 可以少出现以下三种类型的创新：查表填充、计数→索引、箭头→方向+距离；多些其他创新组合。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
