Recolor each non-singleton red object by its symmetry axis and erase isolated red pixels.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and red 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every non-singleton red object has exactly one reflection symmetry category:
  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- Single red pixels are noise.

Rule:
- Start from an all-background output of the same shape.
- Recolor horizontally symmetric red objects blue, vertically symmetric objects
  green, and diagonally symmetric objects pink.
- Leave isolated red pixels as background.

Key insight: The target color is not tied to object position or size; it is a
label for the object's reflection symmetry.

Replace each marker below the separator with the mapped top legend square centered on that marker.

Input structure:
- The background surrounds a top legend, one solid non-background separator row, and a lower marker field.
- The legend contains equal-size filled square sprites, with a singleton marker below each sprite and aligned to its center column.
- The lower field contains only background and marker colors from the legend.

Rule:
- Pair legend markers to legend sprites by left-to-right position.
- Discard the legend and separator; keep the grid width and the rows below the separator.
- In the lower field, replace every marker pixel by a filled square of the paired sprite color, centered at the marker location.

Key insight: The top area is a positional color legend, and the actual output is the post-separator marker field expanded by that legend.

Expand the top-left seed mask into a recursive colored pattern and tile it across the full grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- All foreground lies in a top-left rectangle whose last row and last column are a solid secondary color.
- Removing that secondary-color row and column leaves a seed region containing background plus one primary color.

Rule
- Use the primary-color pixels in the seed as a binary mask.
- Replace each primary seed cell with a copy of the seed mask in the primary color, and each background seed cell
  with a copy of the seed mask in the secondary color.
- Repeat and crop that expanded tile to the original grid shape.

Key insight
The solid L-shaped secondary-color border is a legend, not output content; it supplies the color used when the
seed's background cells are expanded.

Drop the blue sprites downward relative to the red divider, with vertical sprites passing through to the bottom.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a single full-width horizontal divider row.
- The other non-background color forms 4-connected sprites above the divider.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite pixels.
- A one-column sprite falls to the bottom of its column and deletes the divider
  pixel it crossed.
- Any wider sprite falls until its unique widest horizontal row is immediately
  above the divider row; if the moved sprite overlaps the divider, it covers it.

Key insight:
The red row is not a generic floor: only one-column sprites pass through to the
bottom, while wider sprites are registered by their widest horizontal segment.

Add a quantity-color label in the top marker column for each horizontal bar.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background and one non-background marker pixel in the top row.
- Below the marker row, every non-empty source row contains one solid monochrome horizontal bar to the left of the marker column.
- Source rows are staggered every other row.

Rule
- Copy the input grid.
- For each source bar, read its quantity as the bar length.
- Paint the quantity color in the marker column on the same row as the bar:
  2->1, 3->4, 4->9, 5->6.

Key insight
- The grey marker supplies the result column, while each bar supplies a small quantity with a fixed color code.

Slide each foreground object horizontally to the edge indicated by whether its shape has an open notch.

Input structure:
- Yellow is the background and there is one blue foreground color.
- The foreground is split into separated 4-connected objects.
- Each object keeps its row span and shape in the output.

Rule:
- If an object's bbox border contains a background gap flanked by object pixels along that same border, slide it to the right edge and recolor it green.
- Otherwise slide the object to the left edge and recolor it red.
- Start from a blank background canvas; no moved objects overlap.

Key insight:
- The target side is encoded by the object's shape, not by its original position: open notches go right, while closed or solid shapes go left.

Move each gray bar into its adjacent orange rectangle as full stripes from the contacted edge.

Input structure
- The scene uses black outside space, yellow fill, gray one-cell-thick bars, and solid orange rectangles.
- Each gray bar 4-touches exactly one orange rectangle; some orange rectangles have no touching gray bar.
- Gray bars touching the same orange rectangle all have the same orientation.

Rule
- Recolor every original gray cell to yellow.
- For each orange rectangle touched by gray bars, count the gray cells assigned to that rectangle.
- Horizontal gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange rows starting from the contacted top or bottom row.
- Vertical gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange columns starting from the contacted left or right column.
- Orange rectangles with no touching gray bar remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The gray pixels are not copied by shape; their count is transferred into the neighboring orange rectangle as edge-aligned row or column stripes.

Advance the marker from one half of a vertical bar to the same half of the next longer bar.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color forms many vertical one-cell-wide bars; the other appears as a single vertical marker segment.
- The marker segment occupies exactly the top or bottom half of its containing vertical bar.
Rule
- Recolor the current marker segment back to the bar color.
- Find the unique all-bar-color vertical bar whose height is two pixels greater than the marked source bar.
- Recolor the same half of that next longer bar to the marker color.
Key insight
- Each bar's total height encodes an ordered size, and the marker advances from a 2k bar to the corresponding 2(k+1) bar while preserving whether it marks the top or bottom half.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Grow an alternating pink/orange triangular trace downward from the horizontal orange seed row.

Input structure:
- The grid has a green background and one horizontal row containing all orange foreground pixels.
- The seed row may contain isolated orange pixels and adjacent orange runs.
- Pink is absent from the input and is used for the first generated row.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- Two rows below the current active row, place a child pixel between each active pair
  whose middle cell in the current row is background.
- Alternate generated row colors between pink and orange, stopping when no children
  can be generated or the next row would leave the grid.

Key insight:
- Only an active-background-active triplet in the current row reproduces; contiguous
  active runs do not produce children through occupied middle cells.

Decode a block-grid image by swapping each sprite-coded cell with a solid cell and each blank cell with the sprite.

Input structure
The grid is partitioned by black separator rows and columns into equal-size
square blocks. Each block is either a copy of one two-color sprite or a
uniform blank block of the sprite's minority color; grey pixels are erased
cells that act as wildcards.

Rule
Infer the repeated sprite from fully visible mixed-color blocks. Replace a
block matching that sprite, ignoring grey erasures, with a solid block of
the sprite's majority color. Replace a uniform blank block with the sprite.
Separator rows and columns, including grey erasures on them, become black.

Key insight
The small sprite is a block-level code for one macro-cell state, and the
uniform minority-color block is the other state; the output renders the
opposite code in each macro-cell while cleaning erased pixels.

Translate the colored objects into the most balanced complete rectangular frame.

Input structure
A grid with one dominant background color and several monochromatic
4-connected foreground objects that are straight bars or corner-like line
sprites.

Rule
Preserve every foreground object exactly, allowing translation only, and
place the objects so they cover every pixel of a one-cell-thick rectangular
frame exactly once; the frame interior is the background color.

Key insight
The output shape is not copied from the input: the foreground pixel count
determines possible frame sizes, and the intended output is the valid frame
assembly with the least difference between height and width.

Swap a connector segment with repeated marker sprites by connecting the marker anchors and stamping the sprite at the segment endpoints.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors. One foreground color forms a single straight 8-connected segment. The other foreground color forms two or more identical centered sprites.

Rule
Build a background canvas of the same size. Draw straight connector-color segments between every pair of original sprite anchors. Then stamp the marker sprite, using its centered anchor, onto the two endpoints of the original connector segment.

Key insight
The original segment endpoints are the destinations for the repeated sprite, while the original sprite centers become the vertices of the new connector-color complete graph.

Emit diagonal beams from framed 2x2 blocks through frame gaps; beams interact on collision.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall color (e.g. green) forms 4x4 frames around 2x2 monochrome blocks.
- Each frame has one or more gap pixels where the wall is missing.

Rule:
- Each gap emits a beam of the inner block's color, traveling diagonally outward (direction set by gap position relative to the block).
- Beams paint every cell they cross until they hit the grid edge or collide.
- 90° collision: both beams turn 45° toward their bisector direction; the intersection cell is left blank (1-pixel gap).
- 45° collision: beams merge into a zigzag (alternating cardinal + diagonal steps) with no gap at the meeting point.

Key insight: Two distinct collision rules — 90° produces a gap and single-pixel diagonal lines; 45° produces no gap and thicker zigzag bands.

Assemble scattered colored fragments into a left-right symmetric rectangle, jigsaw-style.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; remaining colors form small sprite fragments.
- Optional roles: 4 singleton pixels of one color mark corners; horizontal bars mark top/bottom edges; paired vertical lines mark left/right edges.

Rule:
- Collect all non-bg connected components as jigsaw pieces.
- Determine output rectangle dimensions from total piece area.
- Pack pieces into the rectangle so it is exactly mirror-symmetric (left-right) and same-color pieces never 4-touch.

Key insight: Left-right symmetry plus the no-same-color-touching constraint make the assembly unique; corner/edge markers anchor it when present.

Cast yellow horizontal and vertical rays from the teal rectangle until blue blockers stop them.

Input structure:
- A black-background grid containing one solid teal rectangle.
- Blue objects are blockers; other non-background objects may lie in the ray paths.
- Yellow is absent from the input and is the output paint color.

Rule:
- From every row of the teal rectangle, cast rays left and right to the grid edge.
- From every column of the teal rectangle, cast rays up and down to the grid edge.
- A ray stops before a blue pixel; all crossed non-blue, non-teal pixels become yellow.

Key insight:
The teal rectangle defines a full cross-shaped projection, while blue objects are walls and red/background cells are simply paintable space.

Drop the singleton marker into the matching red U-shaped container, or make a bottom-row puddle if no closed container is hit.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one singleton marker pixel on the top row,
  and one other foreground color forming vertical bars and bottom segments.
- A closed container is a U shape: two vertical side bars with a continuous
  bottom segment between them and an empty rectangular interior above the bottom.

Rule
- Remove the top marker from its original cell.
- If exactly one closed U-shaped container has the marker column within its
  horizontal footprint, fill that container's empty interior with the marker color.
- If no closed container is under the marker column, fill the whole bottom row
  with the marker color.

Key insight
- The marker does not identify a color by value; it identifies a vertical drop
  column, and only a structurally closed U shape can catch and contain the fill.

Assemble colored sprites into a central bar's notches, chaining successive pieces along fixed-width strips.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Largest monochrome component is a solid "bar" with boundary notches (bg holes opening to its bbox edge).
- Several smaller colored sprites scattered around the bar.

Rule:
- Each bar notch is filled by a root piece whose shape exactly covers the hole.
- The root defines a strip (column-span or row-span) for its chain.
- Successive pieces fill the bg cells inside the previous piece's bbox, locked to the same strip width.
- Multiple chains grow independently from different bar notches.

Key insight: The root piece's extent perpendicular to the chain direction locks the strip width for all subsequent pieces in that chain.

Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Recolor the separated outer regions by rotating their colors one step clockwise around the yellow-orange divider.

Input structure:
- The grid contains a fixed yellow/orange divider structure.
- All other colors form separated 4-connected monochrome regions around that divider.

Rule:
- Leave the yellow and orange pixels unchanged.
- Sort the non-divider regions by their centroid angle around the divider centroid in screen-coordinate clockwise order.
- Each region keeps its cells and receives the color of the previous region in that cyclic order.

Key insight:
- The objects do not move; only the color labels cycle through the spatial order of the regions around the divider.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
