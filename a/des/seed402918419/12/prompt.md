Replace gray plus-shaped damage masks with the hidden colors of the rectilinear mosaic.

Input structure:
- Color 8 appears only as isolated 3x3 plus masks.
- The non-mask pixels are visible parts of a clean grid made from horizontal
  and vertical color regions.

Rule:
- Treat every color-8 pixel as unknown damage and leave all other pixels fixed.
- First copy unknown pixels from exact matching parallel rows or columns.
- Then fill any remaining mask cells from opposite-side continuations and the
  better-supported local straight edge.

Key insight:
- The gray pluses are occluders, not objects; the underlying colors are
  determined by repeated line templates and nearby axis-aligned boundaries.

Move the closest reachable maroon pixels into the 3×3 block around the unique red center.

Input structure:
- bg = orange floor, magenta walls, scattered maroon (9) pixels.
- A unique red (2) pixel marks the center of a 3×3 destination block.

Rule:
- Maroon pixels connected to the destination through floor/maroon cells (not blocked by walls) are candidates.
- Rank candidates by distance to the destination; the closest ones fill the block in row-major order.
- Moved maroons are erased (replaced with floor color).

Key insight: Wall barriers restrict connectivity — only maroon pixels reachable via flood-fill through the floor qualify, so proximity alone isn't enough.

Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

Paint the maze corridor and framed rooms lying on shortest paths between the two colored endpoint components.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one wall color forming thin orthogonal frames, and one endpoint/fill color.
- The endpoint/fill color forms exactly two 4-connected solid rectangular components; their larger side lengths define the framed room sizes.

Rule
- Treat wall pixels as blocked and every other pixel as passable.
- Find every passable pixel that lies on a shortest 4-connected path between the two endpoint components.
- Also fill any framed square room of an endpoint-derived size that intersects that shortest-path mask.

Key insight
- Shortest paths identify the route through open connector corridors, while the wall-bordered square rooms need to be expanded from the route centerline to their full interior.

Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by replacing singleton markers, filling short orthogonal gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
- Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
- Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all singleton pixels.
- Red singleton markers are missing line cells; yellow singleton markers are directional controls next to a line endpoint.

Rule:
- Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, preferring an endpoint supported along that same axis.
- For each line color, fill the gap between consecutive facing endpoints in a row or column.
- A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
- At crossings, yellow-control rays win; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while pure filled crossings use the lower color id.

Key insight: The singleton markers identify which sparse stroke fragments belong together; after they are colored, the intended lines are the axis-aligned gaps between facing endpoints, with yellow controls flipping one arm to the marked side.

Rotate each magenta source pixel 90 degrees counterclockwise around its matched blue pivot, recoloring the new pixel orange.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are blue pivot pixels and magenta source pixels.
- Each magenta source can be paired one-to-one with a blue pivot in the same
  row or column.

Rule:
- Remove all magenta source pixels.
- For each matched source/pivot pair, preserve the source distance from the
  pivot but rotate its offset 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Paint the rotated in-bounds target orange; if the target is outside the
  grid, the source simply disappears.

Key insight:
The blue pixels are rotation centers, and row/column alignment gives a
unique global matching from each magenta source to its pivot.

Grow four clockwise spiral wall paths from the tips of a teal cross.

Input structure:
- bg = 0 (black). A single teal (8) cross centered in the grid.

Rule:
- Each arm tip launches a "turtle" heading 90° right of its outward direction.
- Movement priority: turn right > go straight > turn left (left only if not on border).
- Normal step = 2 cells; step right after a turn = 1 cell.
- Each new cell must have a 1-cell orthogonal gap from all existing walls except the predecessor.

Key insight: The right-turn preference plus alternating 2/1 step lengths creates self-avoiding spirals that tile the grid with uniform spacing.

Fill the one blank in each corner region so all four regions have the same color multiset.

Input structure:
- The dominant background color forms one solid separator row and one solid
  separator column.
- The separator cross splits the grid into four equal rectangular corner regions.
- Each corner region contains exactly one background-colored blank pixel.

Rule:
- Count the non-background colors in each corner region.
- The completed region multiset is defined by the maximum observed count of
  each color across the four regions.
- Replace each region's blank pixel with the single color needed to match that
  completed multiset.

Key insight:
- The separator color inside a corner region is a missing value marker; comparing
  the four regions reveals the shared multiset without using numeric color order.

Sort vertical bars by height and redistribute them across fixed colored slots.

Input structure:
- bg background; a horizontal base line of a single color spans the full grid width.
- Several monochrome vertical bars of distinct colors rise upward from the base line.

Rule:
- Rank bar shapes by height (shortest to tallest).
- Rank original x-positions (slots) left to right.
- Place the i-th shortest shape into the i-th leftmost slot, recoloring it to that slot's original color.
- The base line is preserved unchanged.

Key insight: Each slot keeps its x-position and color identity; only the bar silhouettes are redistributed among slots by height order.

Move every foreground pixel by the fixed offset indicated by its color.

Input structure:
- The grid has a unique dominant background color.
- The foreground is a sparse set of colored pixels.
- Each foreground color is one of the trained motion colors: orange, red,
  maroon, or blue.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Translate orange pixels up 2 cells, red pixels left 2 cells, maroon
  pixels down 2 cells, and blue pixels right 1 cell.
- Preserve each moved pixel's original color.

Key insight:
The foreground color is the motion instruction; position only determines
where that color-specific displacement lands.

Assemble scattered rectangular pieces into a rectangle at an L-marker corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg rectangular pieces scattered on the grid.
- 3-pixel L-marker (2x2 minus one cell) tags the corner; the gap is the corner cell.

Rule:
- rect_col = most common color across all piece pixels; all outer rectangle edges must be rect_col.
- Translate pieces (no rotation) to tile the rectangle; touching edges must match, with rect_col as wildcard.

Key insight: rect_col acts as wildcard during edge matching — only non-rect_col pixels at shared boundaries must agree.

Move each vertical stream of pixels into a bottom-aligned centered pile.

Input structure
- A mostly background grid contains one or more vertical source columns of
  foreground pixels.
- Each source column has n^2 foreground pixels, and the top-to-bottom color
  sequence splits into monochrome groups of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Rule
- Clear the canvas to background.
- For each source column, read the foreground colors from top to bottom and
  rebuild them at the bottom below the same column as odd-width centered
  rows of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Key insight
- The scattered vertical pixels are falling grains; a square number of
  grains decomposes into the odd row widths of a centered pyramid.

Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

Rebuild the foreground rectangles as a largest-to-smallest lower-left nesting.

Input structure
- A periodic wallpaper background is overlaid by foreground colors that each form a rectangular frame or solid rectangle.
- The largest foreground rectangle is the output frame; smaller foreground rectangles are the objects to nest inside it.
- A frame may be partially hidden by a smaller rectangle, but its visible pixels still determine its bbox.

Rule
- Ignore the wallpaper and crop the result to the largest foreground rectangle's bbox size.
- Sort foreground rectangles by bbox area from largest to smallest.
- Reconstruct each frame or solid rectangle, placing every next smaller rectangle in the lower-left of the current rectangle's usable region.

Key insight
- The scattered background colors are not objects; the meaningful order is the unique descending rectangle size chain, and each step nests into the previous rectangle's lower-left interior.

Use local source-target-pattern examples to replace matching source pixels.

Input structure:
- Black background with isolated colored pixels and teal (8) pattern components.
- A rule example is a 4-neighbor colored pair source->target whose continued
  direction reaches an anchor touching a teal pattern component.

Rule:
- For each rule example, copy that teal component onto every other pixel of
  source.color, recoloring the copied component to target.color.
- Translation maps the rule anchor onto the source pixel being replaced.
- Remove teal components and all pixels used by rule examples.

Key insight: The two adjacent colored pixels define the color substitution and
the anchor point; the nearby teal component is the stencil that gets recolored.

Complete a visible crop into the shared 20x20 binary motif in its matching orientation.

Input structure:
- The grid is a two-color rectangular crop of one rotation/reflection of the same 20x20 motif.
- One color is the motif foreground and the other color is the motif background.

Rule:
- Try each input color as the foreground mask.
- Match that mask against every possible window in every dihedral orientation of the motif.
- Repaint the uniquely matched full 20x20 motif with the matched foreground/background colors.

Key insight:
- The examples are partial windows of one canonical binary pattern; the local crop is distinctive enough to identify the full orientation and offset.

Extend row bars periodically across the opposite side of a separator column.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A near-solid vertical separator divides the grid into two sides.
- One side contains horizontal colored bars; the other side is blank target space.
- Bars may be stacked by row and may sit at different distances from the separator.

Rule:
- Identify the separator as the column whose non-bg cells are one color.
- Treat the denser side as the bar side and collect each contiguous row run.
- Process bars from nearest to farthest from the separator; for each bar, paint its
  color every bar-length cells into the blank side without overwriting earlier paint.

Key insight: Each bar's length is the period for its extension, and nearer bars claim target cells first.

Expand each 3-pixel L marker into a same-color corner L on an empty background.

Input structure
- The grid is an odd square with one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a monochromatic 4-connected 3-pixel L inside a
  2x2 box.

Rule
- Clear the grid to the background.
- For each marker, map its L orientation to the corresponding outer corner
  and draw that corner L in the marker color with arm length half the grid.

Key insight
- The small marker is a miniature corner; its orientation, not its position,
  chooses which outer corner receives the expanded L.

Recolor the separated outer regions by rotating their colors one step clockwise around the yellow-orange divider.

Input structure:
- The grid contains a fixed yellow/orange divider structure.
- All other colors form separated 4-connected monochrome regions around that divider.

Rule:
- Leave the yellow and orange pixels unchanged.
- Sort the non-divider regions by their centroid angle around the divider centroid in screen-coordinate clockwise order.
- Each region keeps its cells and receives the color of the previous region in that cyclic order.

Key insight:
- The objects do not move; only the color labels cycle through the spatial order of the regions around the divider.

Swap a connector segment with repeated marker sprites by connecting the marker anchors and stamping the sprite at the segment endpoints.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors. One foreground color forms a single straight 8-connected segment. The other foreground color forms two or more identical centered sprites.

Rule
Build a background canvas of the same size. Draw straight connector-color segments between every pair of original sprite anchors. Then stamp the marker sprite, using its centered anchor, onto the two endpoints of the original connector segment.

Key insight
The original segment endpoints are the destinations for the repeated sprite, while the original sprite centers become the vertices of the new connector-color complete graph.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
