Build a red ray network by activating blue blobs via directional green ports.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Large blue blobs with adjacent green pixels marking port directions.
- Start marker: yellow pixel atop a short red segment at grid bottom.

Rule:
- Extend a ray upward from start; on hitting a blue blob, recolor it red.
- Activated blobs emit thick rays through green ports until boundary or another blob.
- Cascade until no new blobs are reached.

Key insight: Green pixels encode ray direction and width; the network activates as a chain reaction from one start point.

Replace each colored corner marker with its corner-specific inward stencil in the same color.

Input structure
- The grid is 8x8 with a single dominant background color.
- Foreground pixels are marker pixels, each located at one of the four corners.
- A marker's color is carried to the stencil selected by its corner position.

Rule
- Erase each corner marker back to the background.
- Top corner markers become an inward 2x2 block one cell away from the top and side edges.
- Bottom corner markers become the mirrored three-pixel inward bent stencil shown by the bottom-corner examples.

Key insight
- The marker position selects the fixed stencil; the marker color only supplies the paint color, so multiple corners apply independently.

Move every object above the solid bottom stripe upward by its own pixel count.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, exactly one full-width non-background row
that acts as a fixed stripe, and one or more 4-connected monochrome objects
above that stripe.

Rule
Clear each object from its original cells, then translate it straight upward
by the number of pixels in that object, preserving its shape and color. Leave
the full-width stripe unchanged.

Key insight
Each object's area is also its vertical displacement; the full-width row is a
fixed baseline, not a moving object.

Complete a sparse grid by casting occluding diagonal rays from the longest run and filling the remaining diagonal-connected regions from the short bars.

Input structure
- Black-background grid with one unique longest 4-connected foreground object.
- The longest object is a horizontal or vertical multicolor run; all other foreground objects are shorter monochrome bars.

Rule
- On a blank canvas, process the longest run from left to right or top to bottom; each pixel emits four 45-degree rays that stop at the first already-painted pixel.
- Each remaining monochrome bar fills every still-blank pixel reachable from it by diagonal steps.

Key insight
- Earlier pixels in the long run occlude later diagonal rays, and those ray barriers partition the background into diagonal-connected regions for the short bars.

<description>
Move each source pixel toward the separator when it matches its aligned reference pixel, otherwise to the far edge.

Input structure:
- A single full separator line is part of a rectangular frame; the frame's
  extra cells mark the reference side.
- On the reference side, one row or column of colored pixels is aligned
  with one row or column of source pixels on the opposite side.
- Each side has its own dominant background color.

Rule:
- Compare each source pixel with the reference pixel on the same row or column.
- If their colors match, place the source pixel in the cell adjacent to the
  separator on the source side.
- If their colors differ, place the source pixel on the far outer edge along
  the same row or column.
- Erase the original source pixels to the source-side background; keep the
  frame and reference pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The extra frame cells identify which side is the reference; equality with the
aligned reference pixel decides whether each source pixel moves inward or outward.

Drop the blue sprites downward relative to the red divider, with vertical sprites passing through to the bottom.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a single full-width horizontal divider row.
- The other non-background color forms 4-connected sprites above the divider.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite pixels.
- A one-column sprite falls to the bottom of its column and deletes the divider
  pixel it crossed.
- Any wider sprite falls until its unique widest horizontal row is immediately
  above the divider row; if the moved sprite overlaps the divider, it covers it.

Key insight:
The red row is not a generic floor: only one-column sprites pass through to the
bottom, while wider sprites are registered by their widest horizontal segment.

Crop the largest object and overlay each smaller sprite where its shared marker pattern matches.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color, and the foreground has one largest destination object plus smaller source sprites.
- Each source sprite shares exactly one marker color with the destination object.

Rule
- Output the tight bbox crop of the largest object.
- Translate each source sprite so every connected marker component of the shared color exactly matches destination marker components.
- Paste source sprites in decreasing area order, so smaller sprites can sit on top of larger ones when they overlap.

Key insight
- The shared-color marker components are alignment keys; matching whole marker components distinguishes singleton slots from larger same-color marker blocks.

Count colored objects and record tallies inside a legend box.

Input structure:
- A black rectangular legend box with key-color pixels in its leftmost non-black column.
- Outside the box, distinct objects of each key color are scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- For each key color, count separate same-colored objects outside the legend box.
- Output the legend box repainted: each key row gets one dot per object, spaced every other cell rightward from the key pixel.

Key insight: The legend is both the color index and the output canvas — object counts become dot sequences on the matching row.

Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Fit a grey bar into a grey frame by aligning projections with colored columns, then stack colors above.

Input structure:
- bg, a grey structural color forming two components: a large rectangular frame (slot) and a smaller bar with upward projections.
- Colored pixels inside the slot mark target columns.

Rule:
- Move the bar upward into the slot so its bottom edge sits one cell above the slot's interior bottom.
- Shift it horizontally so the bar's upward projections align column-wise with the colored pixels in the slot.
- Stack the colored pixels immediately above the bar projections in each column.

Key insight: The bar's projections act as keys that must align with the colored-column "locks" in the slot.

Transfer center colors between bordered sprites matched by color, keeping only path-connected ones.

Input structure:
- bg, grey (5) path network, and several small "bordered sprites" each having a border color and a single center pixel of a different color.
- Grey path forms a one-stroke trail under 8-connectivity; its start/end cells touch exactly two destination sprites via ports.

Rule:
- Destination sprites are determined by the grey trail's two endpoints.
- For each destination, find the source sprite whose border color equals the destination's center color.
- Replace the destination's center pixel with the source's center color.
- Delete all non-destination sprites; grey paths and destinations remain.

Key insight: Center color of each destination acts as a lookup key into the border colors of other sprites, enabling indirect color transfer.

Remove each fracture marker line and push the surrounding object pixels one cell away from it.

Input structure
- A background grid with 8-connected foreground objects made from a body color and a rarer marker color.
- Each object has a non-square bbox; the marker pixels form one complete fracture line across the shorter bbox axis.

Rule
- Erase all marker pixels.
- For a wide object, each row has one marker; body pixels left of it shift one cell left and body pixels right of it shift one cell right.
- For a tall object, each column has one marker; body pixels above it shift one cell up and body pixels below it shift one cell down.

Key insight
- The marker line is a crack through the object, so the two sides separate by one pixel perpendicular to the crack.

Expand the sparse dot lattice into a 26x26 drawing with thick bars between adjacent matching dots.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground pixels lie on logical rows and columns separated by background spacer rows/columns.
- A logical row or column is present when it contains at least one foreground pixel.

Rule
- Expand every background spacer row/column to thickness 2.
- Expand the logical rows/columns equally so the full output is 26x26.
- Paint each foreground logical pixel as a solid rectangle of its color.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels horizontally through the intervening spacer.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels vertically only when neither endpoint is part of a horizontal same-color run.

Key insight
- The input is a sampled line drawing: horizontal same-color runs define the bars first, and only unclaimed same-color vertical neighbors are joined.

Compress each colored ray pixel inward until it touches that color's 3x3 anchor block.
Input structure
- A uniform background grid with non-background colors.
- Each foreground color contains one solid 3x3 anchor block; all other pixels of that color lie on straight 8-neighbor rays aimed at that block.
Rule
- Keep anchor blocks fixed, erase loose foreground pixels, and for each ray pack its pixels into consecutive cells adjacent to the anchor along the same ray.
Key insight
- The scattered pixels are displaced pixels on visible row, column, or diagonal sightlines back to their same-colored 3x3 block.

Repeat the single colored border segment around the rectangular border, leaving one segment-length gap between copies.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is exactly one foreground color.
- All foreground pixels form one contiguous segment on the rectangular border, possibly crossing the cycle start.

Rule:
- Unwrap the grid border clockwise into a cyclic path.
- Let n be the length of the foreground segment.
- Copy the segment with the same color every 2*n border positions around the cycle.

Key insight:
- The foreground segment is not extended by rows or columns directly; it is a motif on the perimeter cycle, repeated with an equal-sized gap.

Merge same-sized filled rectangular objects by overlaying their internal marker pixels.

Input structure:
- A dominant background surrounds two or more separated 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every object is a filled rectangle of the same size.
- Each rectangle has the same majority base color plus one or more non-base marker pixels.

Rule:
- Create one output rectangle with the shared object size, filled with the shared base color.
- For each input rectangle, copy every non-base marker pixel to the same relative location
  in the output.
- Marker overlays must either land on base color or agree in color with an existing marker.

Key insight:
The separated rectangles are layers of the same template; their colored marker pixels
combine by local coordinates while the repeated base fill is just the output canvas.

Reorder and stack rectangles by proximity to two colored edge lines.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two edge lines (h + v) meet at a corner marked by a unique color.
- "Blue" line is color 1 if present, else the longer line; other is "red."
- Solid rectangles in the interior.

Rule:
- Sort rectangles by (distance to blue edge, distance to red edge).
- If the blue edge is vertical, rotate each rectangle 90° CCW.
- Stack top-to-bottom, centered horizontally.

Key insight: Edge-line colors encode a coordinate system; proximity to each axis determines stacking order and rotation.

Keep the largest 8-connected motif and replace the corner/control pixels with a solid corner triangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Exactly one grid corner contains a foreground control pixel; it gives the
  corner from which the triangle is painted.
- There is one unique largest 8-connected monochrome foreground object, the
  motif that remains in the output; all other foreground pixels are controls.
- Every foreground component outside that motif is a singleton control pixel.
- The fill color is the unique control color that appears in at least two
  non-corner control pixels.

Rule
- Start from a blank background canvas and redraw only the largest motif.
- Count the non-corner control pixels; that count is the triangle side.
- Paint the fill color on the right-triangle region where those two distances
  from the marked corner's edges sum to less than the side length.

Key insight
- The scattered singleton controls are counted into a compact triangular
  stack at the marked corner; only the largest motif is not part of the count.

Swap each 5x5 sprite with its corner marker color and stamp same-marker composite masks into the matching corner.

Input structure:
- A 30x30 grid has one dominant background color.
- Non-background corner pixels are marker labels.
- Every other foreground color is the body of one 5x5 sprite containing exactly one pixel of a corner marker color.

Rule:
- For each sprite, recolor body pixels to the sprite marker color and recolor the marker pixel back to its body color.
- If a marker lies on the side facing its matching corner and another same-marker sprite has a body pixel at that same local cell, use that visible body color for the marker pixel.
- For each corner marker, overlay the masks of all sprites with that marker color into the corner 5x5 block and paint the visible composite with the marker color.

Key insight:
The corner pixels are labels that group 5x5 sprites by their embedded marker color; each labeled corner shows the grouped sprite silhouette.

Thicken the sparse frame and stamp the external sparse sprites into it in positional order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a regular lattice color, one large
sparse rectangular frame, and one or more external monochrome sprites whose
pixels also sit on a two-step lattice.

Rule
Use the largest sparse rectangular perimeter as the frame. Clear that frame
region and the external sprite pixels to background, draw a solid one-pixel
border in the frame color, solidify each sparse sprite into its contiguous
two-step mask, and place the sprites inside the frame with equal gaps.
Wide frames receive sprites left-to-right by source position; tall frames
receive them top-to-bottom by source position.

Key insight
The frame supplies ordered slots: the sprite-to-slot assignment is by visible
source order, not by numeric color or by matching individual cells.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
