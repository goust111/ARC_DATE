Keep only the center color and redraw it as a diagonal ray to its indicated corner.

Input structure:
- The grid is an odd square with a unique dominant background color.
- The center pixel is foreground.
- Every off-center pixel with the center color lies in the same diagonal
  quadrant relative to the center.

Rule:
- Fill the whole output with the background color.
- Use the quadrant of the center-colored pixels to choose one diagonal
  direction from the center.
- Draw a continuous line of the center color from the center to the grid
  edge in that direction.

Key insight:
The color at the exact center identifies the surviving color, while the
other pixels of that color identify which corner the center should connect to.

Move the small colored sprite into the hollow frame by stretching its shape to the frame interior.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There are exactly two foreground colors: one forms a complete rectangular
  one-pixel-thick frame, and the other forms one 4-connected sprite outside it.
- The frame interior is initially background.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite from its outside location.
- Map the sprite bbox to the frame interior bbox, sending bbox extremes to
  interior extremes.
- Draw straight horizontal or vertical segments between mapped positions of
  adjacent sprite pixels, then fill any enclosed background region inside
  those drawn segments.

Key insight:
The outside sprite is a miniature line/fill diagram for the frame interior,
not a bitmap to scale by block replication.

Assemble and place enlarged sprites on a canvas using legend-panel instructions.

Input structure:
- Color-6 separators divide the grid into a left legend column and a main canvas.
- Each legend panel has (top to bottom): a unit sprite, a frame template, a 5x5 bordered square with a position-marker pixel, and a 3x3 rotation clock-hand.

Rule:
- Tile the unit sprite into each active cell of the frame to build an enlarged composite.
- Rotate the composite per the clock-hand direction (up=0, right=90, down=180, left=270 degrees).
- Place it on the canvas anchored at the position encoded by the marker pixel's row/col in the bordered square's 3x3 inner grid.

Key insight: The marker pixel's position in a 3x3 grid jointly encodes vertical and horizontal anchor alignment (start/middle/end).

Fill rectangular cavities in a template shape by placing source sprites into matching holes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. A dominant "base" color forms a large frame/template with rectangular gaps.
- Small colored sprites sit outside the template region.

Rule:
- The base color (largest connected component excluding bg) defines the template bbox.
- Each rectangular hole inside the template matches exactly one outside sprite by size.
- Place each sprite into its matching cavity; output is the filled template bbox.

Key insight: Sprite bounding boxes match cavity dimensions exactly — it's a jigsaw-fit puzzle where each piece has a unique slot.

Move each right-side colored shape into the left slot whose template color is its exact complement.

Input structure:
- The grid has two equal-width slots separated by one background column.
- Non-background rows form horizontal bands separated by all-background rows.
- Each band has a shared template color in the left slot and one colored source shape in the right slot.

Rule:
- For each band, define its destination shape as the cells in the left slot not occupied by the template color.
- Normalize every right-side source shape to right-slot coordinates and match it to the unique equal destination shape.
- Clear the original right-side source pixels and paint the matched left-slot complement with the source color.

Key insight:
The right-side objects are not placed by row order; each one completes the unique left template whose missing cells have the same shape.

Infer the background, rotate the whole input 90 degrees counterclockwise, and stack two framed copies vertically.

Input structure:
- Blue is absent from the input.
- One rare marker color appears in exactly two pixels.
- The background is the unique non-marker color whose removal leaves exactly two 4-connected foreground objects, each with one marker pixel and one body color.
- The whole grid, including background and foreground objects, is the sprite to transform.

Rule:
- Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Create a blue one-pixel frame around two vertical copies of the rotated grid.
- Use the input background color for the two endpoints of every horizontal frame/separator row.

Key insight: The output is not a crop of the foreground objects; it is two copies of the complete rotated input, separated and enclosed by a newly added blue border.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Delete each foreign-color object whose bounding box is contained by a larger object of another color.

Input structure
- The black pixels are the empty canvas, and every other color forms one or more 8-connected monochromatic objects.
- Some larger foreground objects act as loose U/C-like containers around smaller objects of different colors.
Rule
- Find all 8-connected monochromatic non-black objects.
- Recolor an object to black exactly when its bounding box is contained in the bounding box of a larger object of another color.
- Keep all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The removable objects are identified by containment in another color's rectangular extent, not by their own color or shape.

Dock two-tone sprites into color-matched horizontal bars with a color swap.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top area: small two-tone sprites (outer color + inner color).
- Below: horizontal bars spanning most of the row, each with a fill color and border color on edges.

Rule:
- Match each sprite to the bar whose fill color equals the sprite's outer color.
- Place the sprite at its original x-position, aligned to the bar's bottom.
- Recolor: sprite outer → bar border, sprite inner → bar fill.
- Erase original sprites from the top area.

Key insight: Color matching is inverted — the sprite's dominant color identifies its target bar, then gets swapped to the bar's accent color.

Drop every large foreground object straight down to the bottom while leaving small marker objects fixed.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color and exactly one foreground color.
- The foreground is split into separated 4-connected objects.
- Objects of area at most three are stationary markers; larger objects are moving sprites.

Rule:
- Clear each moving sprite from its original position.
- Translate each moving sprite vertically downward until its bbox bottom reaches the grid bottom.
- Repaint each translated sprite in its original color; small markers stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- Object area separates the active falling sprites from the small fixed markers, and all active sprites follow the same vertical path.

Recolor each placeholder object according to its normalized shape while leaving the background fixed.

Input structure
A same-size grid with one dominant background color and one foreground
placeholder color forming separated 4-connected objects.

Rule
Replace every placeholder object by the color assigned to its exact
translation-normalized mask; all background pixels remain unchanged.

Key insight
The input objects are a shape legend with repeated instances: identical
masks always receive identical colors, independent of their position.

Complete partial paths inside a framed rectangle by projecting external color traces inward.

Input structure:
- bg, a 1px rectangular frame (border color) with uniform interior fill.
- Colored components outside the frame touching its edges.

Rule:
- Output = the frame's interior, filled with the fill color.
- Map each outside component's frame-touch points into interior coordinates.
- Monochrome components become solid Manhattan stripes between mapped endpoints.
- Two-color components become alternating-color Manhattan paths.

Key insight: Endpoint colors of two-color traces anchor the alternating phase deterministically.

Reorder and stack rectangles by proximity to two colored edge lines.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two edge lines (h + v) meet at a corner marked by a unique color.
- "Blue" line is color 1 if present, else the longer line; other is "red."
- Solid rectangles in the interior.

Rule:
- Sort rectangles by (distance to blue edge, distance to red edge).
- If the blue edge is vertical, rotate each rectangle 90° CCW.
- Stack top-to-bottom, centered horizontally.

Key insight: Edge-line colors encode a coordinate system; proximity to each axis determines stacking order and rotation.

Replace the outlined object with the outside contour of that outline in the marker color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background surrounds one 8-connected foreground outline.
- The outline is the unique largest foreground color.
- One or more smaller interior colors are inside the outline; the marker color
  is the unique smallest non-outline color.

Rule:
- Erase all original foreground pixels to background.
- Paint every background pixel that is 4-adjacent to the outline with the
  marker color.
- Keep the grid shape unchanged.

Key insight: The colored interior marker supplies the paint color, while the
largest outline supplies only the contour whose outside edge is traced.

Let the largest center-pointing object grow outward while every other object loses its inward tip.

Input structure
- The grid has a single dominant background color and four 8-connected monochromatic foreground objects.
- The objects surround a central background gap and point toward it from cardinal directions.
- Exactly one object has the largest area.

Rule
- Find the central background gap by minimizing aggregate distance to the four objects.
- Recolor the nearest-to-center pixel of each non-largest object to background.
- Add a three-pixel cap in the largest object's color on the side away from the center, centered on the shared row or column.

Key insight
- The edit is a transfer of prominence around a common center: losers retract at their tips, and the unique largest object extends outward from the center.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Build a color-labeled shape-equivalence table from the objects listed on the right edge.

Input structure:
- The background contains one main 4-connected object for each foreground color.
- The rightmost column has one singleton pixel of each foreground color, listed top-to-bottom.
- Those singleton pixels define the row and column order of the output table.

Rule:
- Normalize each main object to its tight mask and compare masks up to rotation or reflection.
- Draw 2x2 color labels across the top and down the left, separated by one background row/column.
- For each off-diagonal table cell, paint a 2x2 red block when the two labeled objects have the same shape under rotation/reflection, otherwise paint a 2x2 grey block.
- Leave diagonal cells and all separators as background.

Key insight:
- Object positions and original orientations are distractors; the relation is dihedral shape equivalence, while the right-edge legend fixes the table order.

Drop the columns of the top marker downward, stopping blue-ended columns on grey obstacles and letting maroon-ended columns pass to the bottom.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The most numerous non-background color forms stationary grey obstacle pixels.
- The other two colors form a single 3x3 top-edge marker whose top two rows
  are maroon and whose bottom row contains maroon or blue control pixels.

Rule
- Erase the top marker.
- Treat each marker column as a vertical drop retaining its three colors.
- A column whose bottom control pixel is blue stops immediately above the
  first grey pixel below that column, or bottom-aligns if none exists.
- Contiguous maroon-ended columns pass through obstacles and bottom-align;
  if such a run has a clear down-right slide from a grey ledge, shift the
  run one column right before bottom-aligning.
- When a maroon-ended drop lands through a grey bar on the bottom edge, clear
  the rest of the marker-width gap in that bottom bar.

Key insight
- The bottom row of the top marker is a control strip: blue cells mean
  "stick to the first obstacle," while maroon cells mean "fall through."

Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

Combine each column's repeated template mask with its single solid color swatch.

Input structure:
- The grid is a table of framed panels separated by background rows/columns.
- The leftmost column gives one solid row-label color for each panel row.
- In each panel column, exactly one panel has a solid non-background interior,
  while the other panels share the same mask drawn in one template color on
  the background.

Rule:
- For every panel column, find the row containing the solid interior swatch.
- Rebuild one output panel using that row's left label as the frame color.
- Fill the repeated template mask with the swatch color and leave the mask
  background cells as background; separate rebuilt panels with one
  background column.

Key insight:
The table encodes a colorized stencil per column: the solid panel supplies
the paint color and frame label, while the duplicate template panels supply
the shape mask.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
