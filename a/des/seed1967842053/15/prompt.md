Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

Move every object above the solid bottom stripe upward by its own pixel count.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, exactly one full-width non-background row
that acts as a fixed stripe, and one or more 4-connected monochrome objects
above that stripe.

Rule
Clear each object from its original cells, then translate it straight upward
by the number of pixels in that object, preserving its shape and color. Leave
the full-width stripe unchanged.

Key insight
Each object's area is also its vertical displacement; the full-width row is a
fixed baseline, not a moving object.

Summarize the enclosed table slots by the single object color inside each slot, using the slot background color for empty slots.

Input structure
- The most common color forms the outer background and all enclosed slot
  backgrounds.
- The enclosed background components form a complete rectangular array of
  slots, ordered by their positions.
- Each slot contains either no other color or exactly one object color.

Rule
- Find all 4-connected components of the most common color that do not touch
  the input edge.
- Sort their bounding boxes into row and column order to define the output
  table.
- For each slot, output its unique non-background color if present; otherwise
  output the background color.

Key insight
- The large grid is an expanded table: the enclosed background components are
  the cells, and any colored object drawn inside a cell is that cell's summary
  value.

Mirror colored sprites using red (2) markers as reflection axes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Red (2) = marker color.
- Colored sprites appear near red markers.

Rule:
- Red line within a sprite (vertical or horizontal) → mirror payload across that axis.
- Single red pixel in a mixed sprite → point-reflect payload around it.
- Isolated red pixel (alone, no payload) → point-reflect each adjacent 8-connected color component.
- Originals remain; mirrored pixels overlay.

Key insight: Red marker geometry (line vs single pixel) determines reflection type; isolated vs embedded red determines what gets reflected.

Clean each color layer by enforcing vertical mirror symmetry.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Several non-bg colors, each forming a nearly-symmetric pattern about some vertical axis.
- Some pixels in each color are "noise" that breaks the symmetry.

Rule:
- For each non-bg color, find the vertical axis that best explains its pixel layout.
- Remove any pixel that lacks a same-color mirror counterpart across that axis.

Key insight: Each color has its own independent symmetry axis; the task is per-color denoising, not whole-grid symmetry.

Stagger the two horizontal input regions onto a larger maroon separator canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a rectangular grid with an even number of rows.
- The top half and bottom half are the two regions to preserve.
- Maroon is absent from the input and is used only as the new separator color.

Rule:
- Create an output with one extra row and one extra column, filled with maroon.
- Copy the top half into the upper-left corner.
- Copy the bottom half one row below the top region and one column to the right.

Key insight:
The output is not a recoloring of either region; it inserts an L-shaped maroon
gap by diagonally offsetting the lower half from the upper half.

Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

Recover the bottom-to-top stacking order of overlaid rectangular color frames.

Input structure:
- The background is one color, and every foreground color is a one-cell-thick rectangular frame.
- Overlapping frame pixels show only the color of the frame that is highest at that location.

Rule:
- Reconstruct each frame as the border of the bounding box of its visible pixels.
- At every cell covered by multiple reconstructed frames, the visible frame color is above the other frames covering that cell.
- Return the unique bottom-to-top order of frame colors as a single-column grid.

Key insight:
The hidden parts of each frame do not need to be seen directly; the visible pixels reveal the full frame bbox, and overlap cells reveal the layer constraints.

Scale a minority cell's inner pattern up to the cell-grid level, completing a fractal overlay.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into NxN cells by separator lines of a single color.
- Most cells share an identical interior pattern (majority); a few have a distinct pattern (minority).

Rule:
- Extract the inner pixel pattern from the minority cell.
- Treat each pixel as a cell-sized stamp: active pixels → minority pattern, inactive → majority pattern.
- Position this scaled-up pattern on the cell grid so existing minority cells align with active pixels.
- Fill in all remaining active positions with the minority pattern.

Key insight: The minority cell's interior is a miniature blueprint of where minority cells should appear at the grid scale — fractal self-similarity.

Assemble scattered jigsaw pieces into a rectangle, recoloring each by a legend sprite's color map.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several monochrome non-bg sprites (the "pieces"), scattered across the grid.
- One sprite is the legend: it contains a multi-color k×k patch (typically 2×2) encoding output colors.

Rule:
- Tile all pieces (rotations/reflections allowed) into a tight rectangle with no gaps.
- The legend's k×k color patch defines a spatial color map over the rectangle.
- Each piece is recolored to the legend-map color corresponding to its position in the assembled rectangle.

Key insight: The legend piece doubles as both a jigsaw piece and a color key — its internal k×k palette assigns colors by spatial quadrant.

Move every foreground pixel by the fixed offset indicated by its color.

Input structure:
- The grid has a unique dominant background color.
- The foreground is a sparse set of colored pixels.
- Each foreground color is one of the trained motion colors: orange, red,
  maroon, or blue.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Translate orange pixels up 2 cells, red pixels left 2 cells, maroon
  pixels down 2 cells, and blue pixels right 1 cell.
- Preserve each moved pixel's original color.

Key insight:
The foreground color is the motion instruction; position only determines
where that color-specific displacement lands.

Propagate a repeating striped pattern from a yellow border segment toward the opposite edge, recoloring foreground objects on certain stripes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Foreground blobs of another color scattered in the interior.
- A short yellow (4) segment sits on one border edge.

Rule:
- From the yellow segment, march toward the opposite edge in steps of 2 cells, cycling colors Y, Y, G (4, 4, 3). The 1-cell gap between stripes is forced to bg.
- Yellow stripes paint only within the segment's span.
- Green stripes additionally recolor all non-bg pixels across the entire row/column to green.

Key insight: Green stripes act as a "flood" that recolors existing objects on the full row/column, while yellow stripes are confined to the segment span.

Assemble colored sprites into a central bar's notches, chaining successive pieces along fixed-width strips.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Largest monochrome component is a solid "bar" with boundary notches (bg holes opening to its bbox edge).
- Several smaller colored sprites scattered around the bar.

Rule:
- Each bar notch is filled by a root piece whose shape exactly covers the hole.
- The root defines a strip (column-span or row-span) for its chain.
- Successive pieces fill the bg cells inside the previous piece's bbox, locked to the same strip width.
- Multiple chains grow independently from different bar notches.

Key insight: The root piece's extent perpendicular to the chain direction locks the strip width for all subsequent pieces in that chain.

Convert scattered foreground objects into bottom-aligned count bars in a fixed five-color order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and foreground objects in the task
palette: grey, red, teal, maroon, and pink. Objects are monochromatic
8-connected components; some palette colors may be absent.

Rule
For each palette color in order grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, count its
8-connected objects. Create a background grid with five columns and height
equal to the largest count, then fill each column upward from the bottom
with its palette color for that count.

Key insight
The output does not preserve object shapes or positions; it is a histogram
of per-color 8-connected object counts, using the learned palette order.

Summarize the foreground line objects as ordered horizontal color stripes.

Input structure:
- A dominant background fills a rectangular grid.
- Each non-background color forms one contiguous one-cell-thick line segment.
- The line segments have distinct topmost rows, and there are at most five of
  them.

Rule:
- Sort the foreground colors by the topmost row occupied by their line
  segment.
- Create a 5x3 output filled with the background color.
- Place one solid 1x3 row for each foreground color, preserving that
  top-to-bottom order and padding any unused rows above with background.

Key insight: The exact line length and slope do not matter; only the
vertical order of the colored line segments is encoded in the output stack.

Recolor each non-singleton red object by its symmetry axis and erase isolated red pixels.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and red 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every non-singleton red object has exactly one reflection symmetry category:
  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- Single red pixels are noise.

Rule:
- Start from an all-background output of the same shape.
- Recolor horizontally symmetric red objects blue, vertically symmetric objects
  green, and diagonally symmetric objects pink.
- Leave isolated red pixels as background.

Key insight: The target color is not tied to object position or size; it is a
label for the object's reflection symmetry.

Draw the missing diagonal connector segment between each pair of same-color rectangular objects.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground color appears as exactly two separated solid rectangular 4-connected objects.
- The two rectangles of each color are diagonally offset with facing corners on a 45-degree line.

Rule:
- Keep all existing rectangles unchanged.
- For each foreground color, connect the lower facing corner of the upper rectangle to the upper facing corner of the lower rectangle.
- Paint only the intervening background pixels on that diagonal, excluding the two endpoint pixels already in the rectangles.

Key insight:
- Same-color rectangles define the endpoints; the output completes the open diagonal between their nearest facing corners.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

Move each marked L-shaped sprite onto the separate pixel matching its marker color.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground has 4-connected multicolor sprites and isolated one-pixel controls.
- Each sprite has one repeated body color in an L shape plus one embedded marker
  pixel of a different color.

Rule
- If the embedded marker color also appears as a separate isolated control pixel,
  translate the whole sprite so the body L-bend lands on that control pixel.
- Clear each moved sprite from its old position, clear its consumed control pixel,
  then paste all translated sprites; sprites without a matching control stay put.

Key insight
- The marker color pairs a sprite with its destination control, while the L-bend
  gives the orientation-independent anchor cell to place on that destination.

Crop off the control row and column, then cyclically roll the payload by the two marker offsets.

Input structure
- The grid is square, with a control row on top and a control column on the left.
- The control row and column share one filler color and one single-pixel marker color.
- The lower-right square is the payload and contains none of the control colors.

Rule
- Remove the top control row and left control column.
- Roll the remaining payload down by the marker's zero-based position in the left control column.
- Roll the payload right by the marker's zero-based position in the top control row.

Key insight
- The two border markers are cyclic shift amounts for the payload, not colors to preserve.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
