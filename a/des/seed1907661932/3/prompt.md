<description>
Translate the colored objects into the most balanced complete rectangular frame.

Input structure
A grid with one dominant background color and several monochromatic
4-connected foreground objects that are straight bars or corner-like line
sprites.

Rule
Preserve every foreground object exactly, allowing translation only, and
place the objects so they cover every pixel of a one-cell-thick rectangular
frame exactly once; the frame interior is the background color.

Key insight
The output shape is not copied from the input: the foreground pixel count
determines possible frame sizes, and the intended output is the valid frame
assembly with the least difference between height and width.

<description>
Transfer center colors between bordered sprites matched by color, keeping only path-connected ones.

Input structure:
- bg, grey (5) path network, and several small "bordered sprites" each having a border color and a single center pixel of a different color.
- Grey path forms a one-stroke trail under 8-connectivity; its start/end cells touch exactly two destination sprites via ports.

Rule:
- Destination sprites are determined by the grey trail's two endpoints.
- For each destination, find the source sprite whose border color equals the destination's center color.
- Replace the destination's center pixel with the source's center color.
- Delete all non-destination sprites; grey paths and destinations remain.

Key insight: Center color of each destination acts as a lookup key into the border colors of other sprites, enabling indirect color transfer.

<description>
Split the two-color object horizontally, swap its colors, and slide the upper half to the right.

Input structure:
- The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- All foreground pixels form one 4-connected object with an even-height bbox.
- The object has foreground pixels on both rows adjacent to its horizontal midpoint.

Rule:
- Split the object into upper and lower halves at the midpoint of its bbox.
- Swap the two foreground colors in both halves.
- Keep the lower half in place and shift the upper half right until its lower-left
  boundary pixel is diagonally adjacent to the lower half's upper-right boundary pixel.

Key insight:
- The object is not copied or reflected; it is broken at the horizontal waist,
  recolored by exchanging the two visible object colors, then rejoined diagonally.

<description>
Move the small colored sprite into the hollow frame by stretching its shape to the frame interior.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There are exactly two foreground colors: one forms a complete rectangular
  one-pixel-thick frame, and the other forms one 4-connected sprite outside it.
- The frame interior is initially background.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite from its outside location.
- Map the sprite bbox to the frame interior bbox, sending bbox extremes to
  interior extremes.
- Draw straight horizontal or vertical segments between mapped positions of
  adjacent sprite pixels, then fill any enclosed background region inside
  those drawn segments.

Key insight:
The outside sprite is a miniature line/fill diagram for the frame interior,
not a bitmap to scale by block replication.

<description>
Use the pink control pixel to choose where the maroon pixel belongs inside the grey 3x3 region, and turn the control pixel maroon.

Input structure:
- The grid contains one 3x3 region made from eight grey pixels and one maroon pixel.
- There is exactly one pink control pixel outside that region.

Rule:
- Restore the old maroon cell in the 3x3 region to grey.
- Compare the pink pixel to the 3x3 region: above/same band/below selects top/middle/bottom, and left/same band/right selects left/middle/right.
- Paint the selected cell maroon and recolor the pink control pixel maroon.

Key insight:
- The pink pixel acts as a relative-position marker for a 3x3 target inside the grey region.

<description>
Repaint regions from T-shaped control markers, erase the markers, and optionally rotate based on a color-9 L-marker.

Input structure:
- The grid is a mosaic of monochrome regions.
- Color 1 forms T-shaped control markers on region boundaries.
- Some controls use three singleton color-1 pixels around a colored center; that center is a literal replacement color.
- An optional 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker triggers 90-degree rotation of the output.

Rule:
- For a color-1 T marker, the single stem points at the destination region to repaint.
- The two diagonal cells behind the stem identify the source region; the destination gets that source region's original color.
- For a colored-center T marker, the same stem identifies the destination, but the center color is the replacement.
- All marker cells are filled with the final color of the source-side region.
- A 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker controls rotation: ┐ (corner top-right) → CCW 90°, ┌ (corner top-left) → CW 90°.

Key insight:
- The stem chooses what changes, while the two diagonals behind the stem choose where the marker itself belongs.

<description>
Paint the inner foreground color into every background pixel that touches the enclosing frame only diagonally.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color is an enclosing frame: its bbox strictly contains the bbox of the other, inner color.

Rule:
- Keep all existing pixels unchanged.
- For each background pixel, if it is diagonally adjacent to the frame color and has no orthogonal adjacency to the frame color, recolor it to the inner color.

Key insight: The inner color marks the color to use, while the frame's diagonal-only background neighbors define the cells to add.

<description>
Swap every sprite to the opposite prototype while preserving scale and position.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Two distinct small sprite patterns (prototypes) appear at various scales.
- Each sprite instance is a scaled copy of one of the two prototypes, placed on the grid.

Rule:
- Identify the two prototype patterns from the smallest-area sprites.
- For each sprite, determine which prototype it matches and its integer scale factor.
- Replace it with the other prototype at the same scale, aligned by an internal anchor region (color-1 pixels).

Key insight: Every sprite toggles to the alternate prototype; the anchor sub-region inside each sprite pins the alignment so swapped sprites land in the correct position regardless of scale.

<description>
Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

<description>
Mark the center of each odd-sized solid square with the plus marker color, erasing the marker only when it is outside the marked-center field.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: one unique 3x3 plus marker and one color forming separated solid square objects.

Rule:
- For every non-marker 4-connected object, assert it is a solid square.
- If the square side length is odd, recolor its center pixel to the plus marker color; even-sided squares stay unchanged.
- Preserve the plus marker when its center lies inside the bounding box of the odd-square centers; otherwise erase it to background.

Key insight:
- Odd-sided solid squares have a single visible center pixel, and the plus supplies the color used to identify those centers.

<description>
Move the lower sprite and its pink guide into the upper panel, aligning the sprite to the guide's lower-left branch.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one full-width separator row.
- Below the separator are exactly two foreground roles: a five-pixel guide marker and one monochrome sprite.
- The guide marker has normalized shape {(0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1)} and starts immediately below the separator.

Rule
- Clear the canvas to the background, preserving the separator row.
- Translate the guide marker upward so its top row becomes row 0.
- Move the sprite, preserving its color and shape, so the sprite bbox bottom-right aligns to the translated guide's lower-left branch.

Key insight
- The marker supplies the destination anchor: its lower-left branch cell is where the moved sprite's bbox bottom-right must land.

<description>
Replace a corner L with a same-color right-triangle outline in the corresponding corner of an enlarged canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a square grid with one background color and one foreground color.
- The foreground is a one-pixel-thick L inside a square bbox.
- The L touches exactly one horizontal grid edge and one vertical grid edge, identifying a corner.

Rule:
- Fill a square output canvas of side 3n-2, where n is the input side length, with the background color.
- Double the L leg length to get the triangle side length.
- Draw the two perpendicular triangle legs on the same output corner edges and connect their free endpoints with the diagonal.

Key insight:
- The input L encodes the corner, color, and side length of the triangle outline; the missing side is the diagonal between the L's two free endpoints.

<description>
Mark each arrow-like sprite's pointed frame endpoint with its color and the opposite endpoint black.

Input structure:
- The grid has a one-pixel solid rectangular frame around a dominant interior background.
- Inside the frame are monochrome six-pixel sprites shaped as asymmetric T arrows.
- Each sprite has a length-4 bar and a length-3 crossbar one cell closer to the pointed end.

Rule:
- For each sprite, follow its bar axis from the shorter end to the frame.
- Paint that frame endpoint with the sprite color.
- Paint the opposite endpoint on the same row or column black.
- Leave the interior background, sprites, and all other frame pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The direction is encoded by the crossbar's off-center position: the nearer end is the pointing end.

Decode the colored 3x3 contour motif into a 16x16 periodic lattice with the motif stamped in maroon at the center.

Input structure:
- The grid is 6x6 with orange background and one non-orange color.
- The non-orange pixels have a tight 3x3 bbox containing one contour glyph.
- The glyph is one of the task's period-3 contour forms: plus, H, X, or four corners.

Rule:
- Decode the 3x3 glyph into the period-3 orange phase tile.
- Fill a black 16x16 canvas by repeating that orange phase tile.
- Tile the original 3x3 glyph 2x2 and recolor its true pixels to maroon in the centered 6x6 region.

Key insight:
- The colored object is not copied at its input location; it is a small contour code whose phase tells where orange appears in the repeated lattice.

<description>
Expand the sparse dot lattice into a 26x26 drawing with thick bars between adjacent matching dots.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground pixels lie on logical rows and columns separated by background spacer rows/columns.
- A logical row or column is present when it contains at least one foreground pixel.

Rule
- Expand every background spacer row/column to thickness 2.
- Expand the logical rows/columns equally so the full output is 26x26.
- Paint each foreground logical pixel as a solid rectangle of its color.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels horizontally through the intervening spacer.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels vertically only when neither endpoint is part of a horizontal same-color run.

Key insight
- The input is a sampled line drawing: horizontal same-color runs define the bars first, and only unclaimed same-color vertical neighbors are joined.

<description>
Complete a sparse grid by casting occluding diagonal rays from the longest run and filling the remaining diagonal-connected regions from the short bars.

Input structure
- Black-background grid with one unique longest 4-connected foreground object.
- The longest object is a horizontal or vertical multicolor run; all other foreground objects are shorter monochrome bars.

Rule
- On a blank canvas, process the longest run from left to right or top to bottom; each pixel emits four 45-degree rays that stop at the first already-painted pixel.
- Each remaining monochrome bar fills every still-blank pixel reachable from it by diagonal steps.

Key insight
- Earlier pixels in the long run occlude later diagonal rays, and those ray barriers partition the background into diagonal-connected regions for the short bars.

<description>
Drop the moving-color objects downward until they rest above a one-row cushion before the obstacle or bottom edge.

Input structure:
- The grid has exactly three colors: empty background, a stationary obstacle/floor color, and a moving object color.
- The obstacle color is the unique non-background role that touches the bottom edge.
- Moving pixels start outside the obstacle cells, outside the row directly above each obstacle pixel, and outside the bottom row.

Rule:
- Keep the background and obstacle pixels fixed.
- Treat obstacle pixels, cells directly above obstacle pixels, and the bottom row as blocked.
- Repeatedly move every 4-connected moving-color object one row down when its translated shape does not hit blocked cells or another moving object.

Key insight: The visible floor has an invisible one-row cushion above it, so the objects fall under gravity but stop with one empty row before the floor or the grid bottom.

<description>
Slide yellow pixels inside walled regions in the direction dictated by border-legend arrows.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; yellow pixels sit inside enclosed regions bounded by colored walls.
- Border legends: small rectangles on the grid edge whose fill color C matches a region's border color. Each legend contains a center dot and an indicator dot encoding a direction.

Rule:
- For each enclosed region, identify its border color C and look up the legend with fill color C.
- The direction from the legend's center dot to its indicator dot gives the slide direction.
- All yellow pixels in that region slide in that direction, stacking against the far wall.

Key insight: Legend fill color links to region border color; the center→indicator offset encodes the movement vector.

Repeat the single colored border segment around the rectangular border, leaving one segment-length gap between copies.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is exactly one foreground color.
- All foreground pixels form one contiguous segment on the rectangular border, possibly crossing the cycle start.

Rule:
- Unwrap the grid border clockwise into a cyclic path.
- Let n be the length of the foreground segment.
- Copy the segment with the same color every 2*n border positions around the cycle.

Key insight:
- The foreground segment is not extended by rows or columns directly; it is a motif on the perimeter cycle, repeated with an equal-sized gap.

Compress the stacked colored bars into a compact ordered table with the control pixel on the selected row.

Input structure
- A background grid contains several full-width colored bars from top to
  bottom; the last bar is the base/separator color.
- Each non-base bar may have an aligned three-column comb motif below it,
  alternating side-pair rows with solid rows.
- A singleton control pixel sits away from the colored motifs.

Rule
- Make one output row per non-base bar, preserving top-to-bottom order.
- In that row, paint the bar color once for each solid three-pixel row in
  its motif, then paint the base-bar color in the separator column.
- The singleton control pixel sits immediately above the base bar. Among
  motifs whose open side-pair parity is compatible with that bottom row,
  put the control pixel in the output row with the fewest solid rows; use
  horizontal distance to the motif center only to break count ties.

Key insight
- The vertical comb height is a count, while the control pixel is read by
  projecting it onto the center gap of compatible comb rows rather than by
  its vertical band alone.

# 设计原则

## 一、什么是伪创新

以下模式你必须避免：

**示例 1**：参考题是"按面积排序矩形"，新题改为"按周长排序三角形"。→ 只换了度量和形状，核心机制相同。

**示例 2**：参考题是"缺口编码方向，种子从缺口射出"，新题改为"开口编码方向，液体从开口流出"。→ 只换了隐喻，机制一模一样。

**示例 3**：把"按面积排序"包装成"遮挡推理——从重叠逆推图层深度"。→ 规则实际上不需要遮挡推理，描述夸大了认知难度。

**判断方法**：把新题和每道参考题各用10字以内概括核心机制。如果本质相同（只替换了名词/形容词），就是伪创新。

## 二、人类认知 vs 你的认知

你对"什么对人类来说是难的"有系统性误判。

**你以为隐蔽、但人类一眼就能看出来的：**

| 你常用的机制 | 人类的实际体验 |
|---|---|
| 数缺口/孔洞/标记点数量 → 查表 | 人类本能地数数，这只是算术，不是洞见 |
| 缺口/开口方向 → 编码运动方向 | 人类自然联想到方向 |
| 对称性有一个像素不对 → 检测缺陷 | 人类对对称性破缺极其敏感 |
| 物体面积/周长 → 排序或索引 | 大小是人类最先注意的属性 |
| 箭头/L形/楔形朝向 → 方向指令 | 形状方向性是人类最直觉的感知 |
| 凸凹形状互补 → 拼图匹配 | 人类从小玩拼图，这是本能 |

你觉得这些"隐蔽"，是因为你把"需要一步推导"等同于"隐蔽"。但对人类来说，上述推导都是瞬间完成的视觉直觉。**禁止**将这些作为核心难点。

**对人类真正困难的是：**

人类的难点不在于"看不见信息"，而在于**不知道该用哪个角度去解读眼前明摆着的信息**：

1. **角色反转**：看起来像装饰/边框/分隔线的元素，实际是规则的核心操作对象。人类会下意识忽略它。
2. **非预期的关联维度**：两个物体的关联不是颜色、大小、位置等常见属性，而是某种不常被注意的关系（如包围盒是否重叠、是否共线）。
3. **隐含条件分支**：不同物体执行了不同变换，但人类一开始以为是同一个变换，需要多个样例才能意识到存在分支。
4. **全局约束 vs 局部规则**：每个物体局部看有多种合理变换，但只有一种满足全局一致性。人类倾向局部思考，难以发现全局约束。
5. **输出与输入的结构不对应**：输出不是逐对象修改输入，而是提取全局信息后重新构建全新结构。人类习惯"找对应"，当对应不存在时会卡住。

**核心原则**：难点应在于**视角转换**（想不到要那样看），而不在于**信息提取**（数一下、量一下）。

## 三、如何使用参考题

**错误做法 1（大类归纳）**：把参考题抽象成"空间变换、计数编码、路径追踪、排序重排"等大类，再从这些大类出发生成。这样会导致输出落回固定模板，产生更强的同质性。

**错误做法 2（单题变体）**：挑一道参考题做维度替换/因果反转，产出的只是那道题的换皮。

**错误做法 3（简单融合）**：将两个三个题的机制单纯糅合，没有任何创新想法。

**正确做法**：深入理解每道参考题的具体机制，然后寻找**多道参考题的机制之间的交叉地带**——任何单道题都没涉及、但从多道题的机制中可以自然衍生出的新认知路径，结合多种逻辑进行创新生成新题。

**检验标准**：如果一个候选题可以被自然概括为"参考题 X 的变体"或"参考题 A + 参考题 B 的单纯组合"，则默认淘汰。只有当新题的核心认知路径对人类来说明显不同，且无法被简化回任一参考题时，才保留。

## 四、样例覆盖性

ARC 中颜色变换类题目很常见，没问题。但必须确保做题者能从 3-5 个训练样例中推断出完整规则：

- 如果规则涉及颜色映射，判断这道题是否适合在每个样例中全覆盖所有映射。适合（颜色少、自然全出现）就放心用；不适合（颜色多、每个样例只展示部分）就减少颜色种类，或在网格中放一个**可见的颜色映射图例**（如角落色块对）。
- 颜色在 ARC 中是**无序分类标签**，做题者眼中不存在颜色之间的相邻、大小、运算关系。不要设计依赖颜色编号顺序的规则。
- 同理，如果规则有 N 个分支条件，要么样例覆盖所有分支，要么网格中提供可见的图例说明。
- 自问：只给 3-5 个样例，做题者能否确定所有可能输入的输出？不能的话，减少分支或加入图例。

---

# 你的任务

## 第一阶段：机制草案

深入理解每道参考题的具体机制后，寻找多题机制之间的交叉地带。为每个候选谜题写一个**机制草案**：
- **核心机制（10字以内）**：解题者需要发现的规则本质
- **灵感来源**：借鉴了哪几道参考题的什么元素，如何交叉产生了新认知路径
- **人类视角的难点（1句话）**：做题者最可能被什么误导，规则为什么难以发现

生成 10 个左右的草案。

## 第二阶段：自检淘汰

对每个草案检验：
1. **简化测试**：用更简单的方式重述这个机制。简化后若与某道参考题本质相同，淘汰。
2. **非平凡性测试**：做题者看 2 个样例就能猜出规则，则不够难，淘汰。
3. **可视性测试**：规则依赖的信息是否都能在网格上直接看到？需要计算不可见量的（如"包围盒面积减实际面积"），淘汰或重新设计。
4. **人类难度测试**：核心难点是否落在上面"人类一眼看穿"的表里？是的话，淘汰。

保留 5以上个通过的机制。全部淘汰则回到第一阶段重新构思。

## 第三阶段：完整描述 + 样例验证

## 输出约束（强制）

第一阶段"机制草案"和第二阶段"自检淘汰"只允许在内部思考中完成，不得出现在最终输出中。

最终输出中只允许出现若干个 `<new_puzzle> ... </new_puzzle>` 块。不要输出以下任何内容：
- 分析与思考
- 草案列表
- 自检过程
- 标题
- 分隔线
- 额外解释
- 对生成过程的说明

对每个存活的机制，严格使用以下格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：核心洞见。做题者容易走入什么误区，真正的规则为什么难以发现。

验证样例（颜色首字母：K=Black, B=Blue, R=Red, G=Green, Y=Yellow, E=Grey, M=Magenta, O=Orange, A=Azure, W=Maroon）：

Input:
[5x5 到 8x8 的具体网格]

Output:
[对应的输出网格]

简要说明此样例如何体现规则。

# 格式要求

1. 不依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许简单的计数、排序与数量比较，不允许复杂数学运算。
3. 描述必须极其详细，读完后可直接写代码实现。对特定对象（如箭头）必须明确绘制方式。
4. 使用颜色名称（Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon），不使用数字编号。
5. 网格尺寸 ≤30×30，颜色不超过 10 种。
6. 输出必须以 `<new_puzzle>` 开始，并以 `</new_puzzle>` 结束；除这些块外不得包含任何其他文本。

---

# 最终审查（不需要保存到文件）

1. **原创性**：核心认知路径与任何一道参考题不同。
2. **确定性**：同一输入只能产生唯一输出。
3. **样例一致性**：验证样例的 Output 严格符合 Rule，逐像素检查。
4. **可实现性**：所有细节已给出，可直接写代码。
5. **ARC 合规性**：网格尺寸、颜色数合理，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
