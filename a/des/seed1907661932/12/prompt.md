<description>
Swing an irregular line segment around a nearby obstacle sprite, preserving its pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg, bar color (straight lines perpendicular to the grid edge, one end on the border), segment color (irregular stroke attached to bar's inner endpoint), obstacle color (sprite near the bar terminal).

Rule:
- Each bar is perpendicular to the edge it touches; its inner (terminal) endpoint has an attached irregular segment.
- The segment detaches and re-routes: it travels from the terminal toward the nearest obstacle, hugs the obstacle's boundary, then exits at a 45° diagonal.
- Total painted pixels equal the original segment length.

Key insight: The segment behaves like a rope swung around the obstacle — attach at the nearest point, trace the skin, exit diagonally, conserving length.

<description>
Infer the background, rotate the whole input 90 degrees counterclockwise, and stack two framed copies vertically.

Input structure:
- Blue is absent from the input.
- One rare marker color appears in exactly two pixels.
- The background is the unique non-marker color whose removal leaves exactly two 4-connected foreground objects, each with one marker pixel and one body color.
- The whole grid, including background and foreground objects, is the sprite to transform.

Rule:
- Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Create a blue one-pixel frame around two vertical copies of the rotated grid.
- Use the input background color for the two endpoints of every horizontal frame/separator row.

Key insight: The output is not a crop of the foreground objects; it is two copies of the complete rotated input, separated and enclosed by a newly added blue border.

<description>
Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

<description>
Rotate each blue-started chain of bottom-aligned vertical bars into horizontal bars resting on the same baseline.
Input structure
- The grid has a background and bottom-aligned, one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Blue bars are markers; red bars are body bars that may be chained after a marker.
Rule
- Starting at each blue bar, repeatedly include the next red bar whose column is exactly the current bar's column plus the current bar's height.
- Clear every included vertical bar, then redraw each included bar horizontally to the right from its original bottom cell, with length equal to its vertical height.
- Red bars that are not reached from a blue marker remain unchanged.
Key insight
- A vertical bar's height is also the width it occupies after rotation, so the chain follows immediate horizontal contact after each rotated bar.

<description>
Fill holes inside a large template frame using shape-matched outside sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. One large monochrome frame object (template).
- Inside the frame: holes of various shapes (non-frame-color regions).
- Outside the frame: small monochrome sprites scattered on bg.

Rule:
- Crop to the frame's bounding box; fill entirely with frame color.
- For each hole, find an outside sprite whose shape matches (rotation/flip allowed).
- Fill the hole with the matched sprite's color. If multiple sprites match, use the most frequent color.

Key insight: Sprites act as shape-coded color keys — their shape identifies which hole they fill, their color determines the fill color.

<description>
Replace an orange canvas with concentric Manhattan-distance color rings centered on the lone marker pixel.

Input structure:
- The grid is an orange background with exactly one non-orange marker pixel.
- The marker color is one of the colors in the fixed non-orange ring cycle.

Rule:
- The marker location is distance 0 and keeps the marker color.
- Each step of Manhattan distance away from the marker advances one position
  through the cycle green, yellow, black, grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, blue.
- Fill every pixel of the original grid by this distance-indexed cycle.

Key insight: The output is not copied from existing objects; it is the
distance field around the single marker, colored by a cyclic palette that
excludes the orange background.

<description>
Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

<description>
Complete every colored sprite by applying the union of all aligned partial sprite masks.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each non-background color appears as a separated partial copy of one common sprite mask.
- The copies share a top-left-aligned sprite window; some copies may be missing lower or right edge pixels.

Rule:
- Crop each same-color mask to its bounding box.
- Pad the crops to the maximum observed height and width, aligned at the top-left, and OR them into one complete template.
- Fill that template at every sprite location using the sprite's own color.

Key insight:
- No single input sprite is complete, but their missing cells are complementary, so the aligned union reveals the full mask.

<description>
Recolor vertical bars by legend-driven rank selection.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Top-left: monochrome blocks touching row 0; each has color K and height k.
- Main grid: vertical bars capped top and bottom by a single color, with solid-color interiors.

Rule:
- For each legend entry (K, k), find vertical bars capped by K.
- Rank bars by interior length (longest = rank 1).
- Recolor the rank-k bar's interior to K.

Key insight: Legend height is a rank index into length-sorted bars, not a literal size.

<description>
Complete the scene by adding the point-reflected copy of the colored object across the central marker.

Input structure
- The grid has odd dimensions, a dominant background, and a center-row marker color appearing only at the left edge, center, and right edge.
- A single divider color fills the center column except for the center marker.
- All remaining foreground pixels form the object to copy, entirely on the left side of the divider.
Rule
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For every object pixel, paint the pixel rotated 180 degrees around the center marker with the same color.
Key insight
- The center marker is the rotation center; the yellow-looking divider is not mirrored, it only separates the source from the empty target side.

Emit four teal beams from a square, turning at colored obstacles per a legend.

Input structure:
- Top band: grey (5) legend with colored vertical bars in cells; bar position (left or right) encodes turn direction.
- Below: main grid with bg, a solid teal (8) square, and colored obstacle blocks.

Rule:
- Remove the legend from the output.
- From the teal square, shoot a beam in each cardinal direction (as a sliding copy of the square).
- Each beam paints teal over bg cells as it moves.
- On hitting an obstacle of color C, consult the legend: bar on left → turn counterclockwise, bar on right → turn clockwise. Continue in the new direction.
- Beams stop at grid edges.

Key insight: The legend's bar position (left vs right within its cell) is the encoding for turn direction at each obstacle color.

<description>
Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Select the majority interior marker color, then redraw the framed board as that color's frame plus its bounding-box outline.

Input structure:
- The top row is a copied palette made from adjacent equal color pairs.
- Below it is a one-cell-thick rectangular frame around a black interior.
- Non-black, non-frame interior pixels are marker colors; one marker color has
  the unique highest count.

Rule:
- Keep the palette row unchanged.
- Pick the uniquely most frequent interior marker color.
- Clear the lower board to black, recolor its outer frame with the picked color,
  and draw the picked color's interior bounding-box border.

Key insight:
- The noisy marker cloud is not preserved as pixels; only the majority marker
  color and its spatial extent define the output.

Extract the lattice subregion bounded by the four background-colored corner holes.

Input structure:
- A regular one-cell-thick lattice has one line color, one background color,
  and sparse marker pixels.
- Exactly four lattice-line intersections are background-colored holes instead
  of line-color pixels.

Rule:
- Find the unique non-background color that forms regular horizontal and
  vertical lattice lines.
- Use the four background-colored lattice intersections as the corners of one
  rectangle.
- Return the inclusive crop between those corner rows and columns.

Key insight:
- The crop is marked by the missing lattice intersections, not by the marker
  pixels inside the cells.

Move each gray bar into its adjacent orange rectangle as full stripes from the contacted edge.

Input structure
- The scene uses black outside space, yellow fill, gray one-cell-thick bars, and solid orange rectangles.
- Each gray bar 4-touches exactly one orange rectangle; some orange rectangles have no touching gray bar.
- Gray bars touching the same orange rectangle all have the same orientation.

Rule
- Recolor every original gray cell to yellow.
- For each orange rectangle touched by gray bars, count the gray cells assigned to that rectangle.
- Horizontal gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange rows starting from the contacted top or bottom row.
- Vertical gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange columns starting from the contacted left or right column.
- Orange rectangles with no touching gray bar remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The gray pixels are not copied by shape; their count is transferred into the neighboring orange rectangle as edge-aligned row or column stripes.

<description>
Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Swap each 5x5 sprite with its corner marker color and stamp same-marker composite masks into the matching corner.

Input structure:
- A 30x30 grid has one dominant background color.
- Non-background corner pixels are marker labels.
- Every other foreground color is the body of one 5x5 sprite containing exactly one pixel of a corner marker color.

Rule:
- For each sprite, recolor body pixels to the sprite marker color and recolor the marker pixel back to its body color.
- If a marker lies on the side facing its matching corner and another same-marker sprite has a body pixel at that same local cell, use that visible body color for the marker pixel.
- For each corner marker, overlay the masks of all sprites with that marker color into the corner 5x5 block and paint the visible composite with the marker color.

Key insight:
The corner pixels are labels that group 5x5 sprites by their embedded marker color; each labeled corner shows the grouped sprite silhouette.

<description>
Swap paired marker pixels across the largest foreground-color barrier, placing them just outside the barrier segment.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color is the unique most frequent non-background color; its pixels form the stationary barrier.
- Other foreground pixels are single markers, sometimes paired on opposite sides of one contiguous barrier segment in the same row or column.

Rule:
- Scan each row and column that crosses exactly one contiguous barrier segment.
- If the line has exactly one marker on each side of that segment, erase both source markers and place each marker in the cell immediately beyond the opposite side of the segment.
- Lines with markers on only one side are unchanged; the barrier remains unchanged.

Key insight:
- The marker pairing is local to a row or column, and the destination is defined by the nearest cells outside the intervening barrier segment, not by the original distance from the barrier.

<description>
Paint the top-connected middle channel between two orange path components teal.

Input structure
- The background is black.
- One foreground color forms exactly two 4-connected one-pixel-wide path components.
- Optional non-background control pixels may sit in the channel between the two paths.

Rule
- Dilate each path component by one cell in the 8-neighborhood and intersect the two dilations; this gives the one-cell-wide middle channel.
- A control pixel in that channel is a blocker only when its 4-neighbors touch fewer than both path components; otherwise it is part of the channel and is repainted.
- After removing blockers, paint the channel component connected to the top edge teal and keep all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The desired pixels are not found by region filling; they are the geometric overlap of the two paths' one-cell halos, with weakly attached control pixels splitting the channel.

Push every colored object touching maroon markers straight outward until it reaches the grid edge.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Maroon pixels are fixed markers.
- Every other foreground 4-connected object touches the marker pixels on exactly one cardinal side.

Rule:
- Clear each non-background, non-maroon object from its original position.
- Translate it in the direction away from its maroon contact until the object reaches the grid boundary.
- Keep the maroon marker pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The maroon contact side is a launcher: it determines a unique outward ray for the whole object, and the edge of the grid determines the translation distance.

# 设计原则

## 一、什么是伪创新

以下模式你必须避免：

**示例 1**：参考题是"按面积排序矩形"，新题改为"按周长排序三角形"。→ 只换了度量和形状，核心机制相同。

**示例 2**：参考题是"缺口编码方向，种子从缺口射出"，新题改为"开口编码方向，液体从开口流出"。→ 只换了隐喻，机制一模一样。

**示例 3**：把"按面积排序"包装成"遮挡推理——从重叠逆推图层深度"。→ 规则实际上不需要遮挡推理，描述夸大了认知难度。

**判断方法**：把新题和每道参考题各用10字以内概括核心机制。如果本质相同（只替换了名词/形容词），就是伪创新。

## 二、人类认知 vs 你的认知

你对"什么对人类来说是难的"有系统性误判。

**你以为隐蔽、但人类一眼就能看出来的：**

| 你常用的机制 | 人类的实际体验 |
|---|---|
| 数缺口/孔洞/标记点数量 → 查表 | 人类本能地数数，这只是算术，不是洞见 |
| 缺口/开口方向 → 编码运动方向 | 人类自然联想到方向 |
| 对称性有一个像素不对 → 检测缺陷 | 人类对对称性破缺极其敏感 |
| 物体面积/周长 → 排序或索引 | 大小是人类最先注意的属性 |
| 箭头/L形/楔形朝向 → 方向指令 | 形状方向性是人类最直觉的感知 |
| 凸凹形状互补 → 拼图匹配 | 人类从小玩拼图，这是本能 |

你觉得这些"隐蔽"，是因为你把"需要一步推导"等同于"隐蔽"。但对人类来说，上述推导都是瞬间完成的视觉直觉。**禁止**将这些作为核心难点。

**对人类真正困难的是：**

人类的难点不在于"看不见信息"，而在于**不知道该用哪个角度去解读眼前明摆着的信息**：

1. **角色反转**：看起来像装饰/边框/分隔线的元素，实际是规则的核心操作对象。人类会下意识忽略它。
2. **非预期的关联维度**：两个物体的关联不是颜色、大小、位置等常见属性，而是某种不常被注意的关系（如包围盒是否重叠、是否共线）。
3. **隐含条件分支**：不同物体执行了不同变换，但人类一开始以为是同一个变换，需要多个样例才能意识到存在分支。
4. **全局约束 vs 局部规则**：每个物体局部看有多种合理变换，但只有一种满足全局一致性。人类倾向局部思考，难以发现全局约束。
5. **输出与输入的结构不对应**：输出不是逐对象修改输入，而是提取全局信息后重新构建全新结构。人类习惯"找对应"，当对应不存在时会卡住。

**核心原则**：难点应在于**视角转换**（想不到要那样看），而不在于**信息提取**（数一下、量一下）。

## 三、如何使用参考题

**错误做法 1（大类归纳）**：把参考题抽象成"空间变换、计数编码、路径追踪、排序重排"等大类，再从这些大类出发生成。这样会导致输出落回固定模板，产生更强的同质性。

**错误做法 2（单题变体）**：挑一道参考题做维度替换/因果反转，产出的只是那道题的换皮。

**错误做法 3（简单融合）**：将两个三个题的机制单纯糅合，没有任何创新想法。

**正确做法**：深入理解每道参考题的具体机制，然后寻找**多道参考题的机制之间的交叉地带**——任何单道题都没涉及、但从多道题的机制中可以自然衍生出的新认知路径，结合多种逻辑进行创新生成新题。

**检验标准**：如果一个候选题可以被自然概括为"参考题 X 的变体"或"参考题 A + 参考题 B 的单纯组合"，则默认淘汰。只有当新题的核心认知路径对人类来说明显不同，且无法被简化回任一参考题时，才保留。

## 四、样例覆盖性

ARC 中颜色变换类题目很常见，没问题。但必须确保做题者能从 3-5 个训练样例中推断出完整规则：

- 如果规则涉及颜色映射，判断这道题是否适合在每个样例中全覆盖所有映射。适合（颜色少、自然全出现）就放心用；不适合（颜色多、每个样例只展示部分）就减少颜色种类，或在网格中放一个**可见的颜色映射图例**（如角落色块对）。
- 颜色在 ARC 中是**无序分类标签**，做题者眼中不存在颜色之间的相邻、大小、运算关系。不要设计依赖颜色编号顺序的规则。
- 同理，如果规则有 N 个分支条件，要么样例覆盖所有分支，要么网格中提供可见的图例说明。
- 自问：只给 3-5 个样例，做题者能否确定所有可能输入的输出？不能的话，减少分支或加入图例。

---

# 你的任务

## 第一阶段：机制草案

深入理解每道参考题的具体机制后，寻找多题机制之间的交叉地带。为每个候选谜题写一个**机制草案**：
- **核心机制（10字以内）**：解题者需要发现的规则本质
- **灵感来源**：借鉴了哪几道参考题的什么元素，如何交叉产生了新认知路径
- **人类视角的难点（1句话）**：做题者最可能被什么误导，规则为什么难以发现

生成 10 个左右的草案。

## 第二阶段：自检淘汰

对每个草案检验：
1. **简化测试**：用更简单的方式重述这个机制。简化后若与某道参考题本质相同，淘汰。
2. **非平凡性测试**：做题者看 2 个样例就能猜出规则，则不够难，淘汰。
3. **可视性测试**：规则依赖的信息是否都能在网格上直接看到？需要计算不可见量的（如"包围盒面积减实际面积"），淘汰或重新设计。
4. **人类难度测试**：核心难点是否落在上面"人类一眼看穿"的表里？是的话，淘汰。

保留 5以上个通过的机制。全部淘汰则回到第一阶段重新构思。

## 第三阶段：完整描述 + 样例验证

## 输出约束（强制）

第一阶段"机制草案"和第二阶段"自检淘汰"只允许在内部思考中完成，不得出现在最终输出中。

最终输出中只允许出现若干个 `<new_puzzle> ... </new_puzzle>` 块。不要输出以下任何内容：
- 分析与思考
- 草案列表
- 自检过程
- 标题
- 分隔线
- 额外解释
- 对生成过程的说明

对每个存活的机制，严格使用以下格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：核心洞见。做题者容易走入什么误区，真正的规则为什么难以发现。

验证样例（颜色首字母：K=Black, B=Blue, R=Red, G=Green, Y=Yellow, E=Grey, M=Magenta, O=Orange, A=Azure, W=Maroon）：

Input:
[5x5 到 8x8 的具体网格]

Output:
[对应的输出网格]

简要说明此样例如何体现规则。
</new_puzzle>

---

# 格式要求

1. 不依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许简单的计数、排序与数量比较，不允许复杂数学运算。
3. 描述必须极其详细，读完后可直接写代码实现。对特定对象（如箭头）必须明确绘制方式。
4. 使用颜色名称（Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon），不使用数字编号。
5. 网格尺寸 ≤30×30，颜色不超过 10 种。
6. 输出必须以 `<new_puzzle>` 开始，并以 `</new_puzzle>` 结束；除这些块外不得包含任何其他文本。

---

# 最终审查（不需要保存到文件）

1. **原创性**：核心认知路径与任何一道参考题不同。
2. **确定性**：同一输入只能产生唯一输出。
3. **样例一致性**：验证样例的 Output 严格符合 Rule，逐像素检查。
4. **可实现性**：所有细节已给出，可直接写代码。
5. **ARC 合规性**：网格尺寸、颜色数合理，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
