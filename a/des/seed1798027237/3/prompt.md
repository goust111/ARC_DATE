Use the left-edge color legend to draw a padded rectangular halo around each matching object while preserving enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- One or more two-row markers sit on the left edge; each marker is a 2x2 block whose left column is an object color and right column is its halo color.
- Away from the markers, every source color from the legend appears as one or more 4-connected monochrome objects.

Rule:
- Keep the input pixels unchanged.
- For each source-color object, take its tight bbox expanded by one cell and clipped to the grid.
- Recolor background pixels in that expanded region to the marker's halo color, except for background holes enclosed by the object.

Key insight:
- The small left-edge bars are a legend: they map object colors to the colors used for the surrounding padded bbox.

Complete a grid of colored blocks to match a minimap legend in the top-left corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top-left corner: a small sprite of single colored pixels forming a minimap pattern on a regular lattice.
- Main area: uniformly colored square blocks (NxN) arranged on a regular grid; some positions are empty (bg).

Rule:
- The legend pixels define a color pattern; each pixel's lattice position maps to a block position in the main grid via a fixed scale factor and offset.
- Existing colored blocks confirm the scale/offset alignment.
- For every legend pixel whose corresponding grid position is empty, place a new block of that color.

Key insight: The top-left pixel pattern is a scaled-down minimap of the block layout; the mapping is inferred from blocks already present.

Fill the small background compartments bounded by the long contour color.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and two foreground colors.
- The more frequent foreground color forms long 8-connected contour fragments.
- The other foreground color is a fixed distractor/obstacle color that partitions
  the background but is never recolored.

Rule:
- Split the background into 4-connected regions using all foreground pixels as
  barriers.
- Keep the two largest background regions as the outside of the contour drawing.
- Recolor every other background region that touches a long contour component
  to the contour color; leave all foreground pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The apparent area fill is exactly a component-level fill of bounded background
compartments, not a row-wise interpolation between individual contour pixels.

Complete each boundary tab or notch by adding the complementary feature on the opposite side of the foreground object.

Input structure
- The grid has exactly two colors: a dominant background and one foreground object.
- The foreground object is a thick rectilinear shape with one-pixel tabs and notches on its boundary.

Rule
- A foreground tab is a one-neighbor boundary pixel; project through its full row or column span and remove the opposite edge pixel to make a matching notch.
- A background notch is a one-pixel cut with three foreground 4-neighbors; project across the full row or column span and add a tab just outside the opposite edge.
- Notches immediately beside a tab source are not independent sources, because that gap belongs to the tab's local boundary shape.

Key insight
- The changed pixels are not color-specific noise; they are paired jigsaw-like boundary features on opposite sides of the same thick row or column cross-section.

Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Stagger the two horizontal input regions onto a larger maroon separator canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a rectangular grid with an even number of rows.
- The top half and bottom half are the two regions to preserve.
- Maroon is absent from the input and is used only as the new separator color.

Rule:
- Create an output with one extra row and one extra column, filled with maroon.
- Copy the top half into the upper-left corner.
- Copy the bottom half one row below the top region and one column to the right.

Key insight:
The output is not a recoloring of either region; it inserts an L-shaped maroon
gap by diagonally offsetting the lower half from the upper half.

Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

Compress the L-shaped cue to three rows and add a pink copy of the top-row foreground mask.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a two-color top row, and all
foreground pixels below the top row lie in the first column as vertical markers.

Rule
Keep the input top row as output row 0 and the first marker row as output row 1.
Output row 2 is background except at the top-row foreground columns, which are
recolored pink.

Key insight
The lower repeated marker rows only identify the vertical cue; the generated
row is a recolored mask of the horizontal cue in the top row.

Recover the repeating background pattern hidden under the largest solid rectangle.

Input structure:
- The grid is covered by a small row/column periodic pattern.
- Several non-pattern colors form solid rectangular foreground objects that
  overwrite the pattern.
- The requested output region is the largest of those solid rectangles.

Rule:
- Find every 4-connected monochromatic object whose bounding box is a filled
  rectangle with both dimensions greater than one.
- Treat those rectangles as masks, infer the smallest repeating tile that is
  consistent with all remaining visible pixels, and repaint the largest
  rectangle's coordinates with that tile.

Key insight: The rectangle colors are occluders; the visible pixels outside
them are enough to reconstruct the original periodic background underneath.

Expand each colored control pixel into its corresponding fixed 4x4 glyph.

Input structure:
- Black background with single-pixel markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and/or 8.
- Some inputs also show a sample 4x4 glyph in the output color, with a same-rule marker just below-right of the sample.

Rule:
- Replace each marker color by its learned 4x4 glyph: 2->yellow frame, 3->blue ring, 5->pink diagonal blocks, 8->orange X.
- Paint each glyph with its top-left corner at the marker pixel, clipping at the grid boundary.
- Remove the sample glyphs and skip their below-right label markers.

Key insight:
- The colored pixels are control pixels for a fixed glyph alphabet; non-control sample glyphs are only legend entries, not preserved scene objects.

Delete connected components whose colors match a legend swatch.

Input structure:
- Background (bg) fills most of the grid.
- Top-left corner: a small square legend region bordered on its bottom and right edges by a single color; the interior holds a set of "target" colors.
- Elsewhere: multicolored objects (4-connected components) on the bg.

Rule:
- Read the target color set from inside the legend border.
- For each connected component, check whether it contains **all** target colors.
- Erase (fill with bg) every component that does; leave all others unchanged.
- Output grid is the same size.

Key insight: The legend acts as a filter specification — only components carrying the full color palette shown in the legend are removed.

Assemble colored rectangular sprites into a single tiled rectangle, anchored by a marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Several solid-colored rectangular sprites scattered on the grid.
- One sprite has a unique single-pixel marker (different color) at one corner — this is the anchor.

Rule:
- Identify the anchor sprite (contains the marker pixel) and the remaining pieces.
- Rotate the anchor so the marker pixel lands at position (0,0) of the output.
- Pack all remaining pieces (allowing 90° rotations) to tile a complete rectangle with no gaps.

Key insight: The lone marker pixel picks the anchor and fixes the output orientation — it must sit at the top-left corner.

Mark every complete square object with red pixels just outside its corners.

Input structure:
- A uniform background contains one or more monochrome 4-connected foreground objects.
- The relevant objects are square frames or filled squares: their bbox is square
  and all cells on the bbox border have the object's color.
- Non-square bars and incomplete fragments may also appear and are ignored.

Rule:
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For each complete square object, paint red on the two outside background
  pixels orthogonally adjacent to each of the square's four corners.

Key insight: The transformation is not based on size or color; it selects
objects whose bounding box is a complete square border and labels only their
exposed outer corner-adjacent cells.

Assemble scattered colored fragments into a left-right symmetric rectangle, jigsaw-style.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; remaining colors form small sprite fragments.
- Optional roles: 4 singleton pixels of one color mark corners; horizontal bars mark top/bottom edges; paired vertical lines mark left/right edges.

Rule:
- Collect all non-bg connected components as jigsaw pieces.
- Determine output rectangle dimensions from total piece area.
- Pack pieces into the rectangle so it is exactly mirror-symmetric (left-right) and same-color pieces never 4-touch.

Key insight: Left-right symmetry plus the no-same-color-touching constraint make the assembly unique; corner/edge markers anchor it when present.

Replace each marker below the separator with the mapped top legend square centered on that marker.

Input structure:
- The background surrounds a top legend, one solid non-background separator row, and a lower marker field.
- The legend contains equal-size filled square sprites, with a singleton marker below each sprite and aligned to its center column.
- The lower field contains only background and marker colors from the legend.

Rule:
- Pair legend markers to legend sprites by left-to-right position.
- Discard the legend and separator; keep the grid width and the rows below the separator.
- In the lower field, replace every marker pixel by a filled square of the paired sprite color, centered at the marker location.

Key insight: The top area is a positional color legend, and the actual output is the post-separator marker field expanded by that legend.

Crop off the control row and column, then cyclically roll the payload by the two marker offsets.

Input structure
- The grid is square, with a control row on top and a control column on the left.
- The control row and column share one filler color and one single-pixel marker color.
- The lower-right square is the payload and contains none of the control colors.

Rule
- Remove the top control row and left control column.
- Roll the remaining payload down by the marker's zero-based position in the left control column.
- Roll the payload right by the marker's zero-based position in the top control row.

Key insight
- The two border markers are cyclic shift amounts for the payload, not colors to preserve.

Translate the colored objects into the most balanced complete rectangular frame.

Input structure
A grid with one dominant background color and several monochromatic
4-connected foreground objects that are straight bars or corner-like line
sprites.

Rule
Preserve every foreground object exactly, allowing translation only, and
place the objects so they cover every pixel of a one-cell-thick rectangular
frame exactly once; the frame interior is the background color.

Key insight
The output shape is not copied from the input: the foreground pixel count
determines possible frame sizes, and the intended output is the valid frame
assembly with the least difference between height and width.

Sort vertical bars by height and redistribute them across fixed colored slots.

Input structure:
- bg background; a horizontal base line of a single color spans the full grid width.
- Several monochrome vertical bars of distinct colors rise upward from the base line.

Rule:
- Rank bar shapes by height (shortest to tallest).
- Rank original x-positions (slots) left to right.
- Place the i-th shortest shape into the i-th leftmost slot, recoloring it to that slot's original color.
- The base line is preserved unchanged.

Key insight: Each slot keeps its x-position and color identity; only the bar silhouettes are redistributed among slots by height order.

Draw the marker-colored route through the centers of all doors in the parallel wall maze.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background, parallel full-span walls, one three-pixel door
  segment in each wall, and two marker pixels sharing a color.
- Walls are either all vertical or all horizontal, and the markers are on
  opposite outer sides of the wall set.

Rule:
- Keep the scene unchanged except for the route.
- Visit the door centers in wall order from the upper/left marker side to
  the lower/right marker side.
- In each corridor, draw an orthogonal path to the cell just before the next
  wall, move along that wall to the door center, cross the center, and
  continue to the next corridor; after the last door, connect to the other
  marker.

Key insight:
- The three-pixel door segments mark the only crossing points through a set
  of parallel walls, so the output is the corridor path threaded through
  those centers.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
