<description>
Fire projectiles from 3-pixel triangle sprites; mark collisions with maroon or blue.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg 3-pixel sprites shaped as axis-aligned L's or diagonal V's.

Rule:
- Each triangle has an apex and an emission direction determined by its shape: L-shapes fire diagonally away from the missing corner; V-shapes fire along the axis away from the open side.
- A projectile lands exactly 5 cells from the apex in the emission direction.
- If it hits an existing sprite, that entire sprite is recolored to maroon (9).
- If two projectiles land on the same empty cell, that cell becomes blue (1); a lone projectile on empty bg paints maroon (9).

Key insight: The triangle's orientation encodes both direction and target; dual-projectile collisions on open bg produce blue, not maroon.

Move the yellow 3x3 frame by the displacement encoded by the gray path, then draw its diagonal yellow corner rays.

Input structure:
- The background is black.
- One 3x3 yellow frame has a non-yellow control-color center.
- A second control-color pixel is connected through gray path pixels to a lone yellow endpoint.

Rule:
- Use the vector from the second control-color pixel to the lone yellow endpoint as the frame's translation.
- Fill the whole output with the control color.
- Draw the translated yellow frame and extend yellow diagonal rays outward from its four corners to the grid edge.

Key insight: The gray path's turns are irrelevant; its two colored endpoints encode the net displacement to apply to the frame.

<description>
Extend row bars periodically across the opposite side of a separator column.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A near-solid vertical separator divides the grid into two sides.
- One side contains horizontal colored bars; the other side is blank target space.
- Bars may be stacked by row and may sit at different distances from the separator.

Rule:
- Identify the separator as the column whose non-bg cells are one color.
- Treat the denser side as the bar side and collect each contiguous row run.
- Process bars from nearest to farthest from the separator; for each bar, paint its
  color every bar-length cells into the blank side without overwriting earlier paint.

Key insight: Each bar's length is the period for its extension, and nearer bars claim target cells first.

<description>
Recolor the shortest path between two terminal squares in a square-and-track graph.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two non-bg colors form solid NxN squares (N>=2): one color marks exactly 2 terminals, the other marks stations.
- A third non-bg color forms 1-cell-wide track segments connecting pairs of squares (graph edges).

Rule:
- Find the shortest path (fewest edges) between the two terminal squares.
- Recolor every station square on that path to green.
- Recolor every track segment along that path to grey.
- Everything else unchanged.

Key insight: The grid encodes a graph where squares are nodes and tracks are edges; the task is graph shortest-path, not spatial proximity.

<description>
Fill the parallelogram-shaped region between parallel anti-diagonal line segments with red.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One non-bg color forms short diagonal segments, each lying on a single anti-diagonal (r+c = const).
- Segments come in parallel pairs bounding a region to be filled.

Rule:
- For each main-diagonal axis (r−c = const), collect anti-diagonal segments whose span covers that axis.
- Sort those segments by their anti-diagonal index (r+c).
- Fill all bg cells lying strictly between consecutive segment pairs along that axis with red (color 2).

Key insight: The two diagonal directions decouple — segments sit on anti-diagonals, and filling sweeps along main diagonals between them, forming parallelogram regions.

<description>
Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

<description>
Paint the inner foreground color into every background pixel that touches the enclosing frame only diagonally.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color is an enclosing frame: its bbox strictly contains the bbox of the other, inner color.

Rule:
- Keep all existing pixels unchanged.
- For each background pixel, if it is diagonally adjacent to the frame color and has no orthogonal adjacency to the frame color, recolor it to the inner color.

Key insight: The inner color marks the color to use, while the frame's diagonal-only background neighbors define the cells to add.

Move bordered 5×5 squares to their designated grid edges by border color.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Azure (8) and red (2) bordered 5×5 squares with colored interiors, scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Azure squares → left edge (col 0); red squares → right edge (col W−5).
- Each square keeps its original row.
- Process azure left-to-right, red right-to-left (nearest-to-edge first).
- If a square's rows overlap an already-placed edge square, place it one square-width inward instead.

Key insight: Near-edge-first ordering plus row-overlap determines which square sits at the edge vs. the second column.

<description>
Match sprites to frames by connected-hole count, then nest each sprite inside its frame.

Input structure:
- bg = azure (8). Large hollow squares (frames) arranged in a grid; smaller filled squares (sprites) placed elsewhere.
- Each frame and sprite has a distinct color. Sprites may contain holes (non-sprite-color pixels).

Rule:
- Frames form a regular grid; some may be bg-colored (invisible).
- Count connected hole regions inside each frame's interior and each sprite.
- Pair each frame with the sprite sharing the same hole count.
- Place the matched sprite inside the frame border; recolor sprite holes to the frame's color.

Key insight: The matching key is the number of connected hole components, not hole area or color.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

Straighten the single foreground mask into a centered horizontal segment of the same color and length.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- All non-background pixels share one foreground color.
- The number of foreground pixels fits in one centered row of the grid.

Rule:
- Erase the original foreground mask.
- Count its pixels, keep its color, and paint that many pixels as a horizontal segment.
- Place the segment on the middle row with equal background margin on the left and right.

Key insight:
- The original foreground shape is irrelevant except for its color and area; the output is the area normalized into the grid's central horizontal line.

Keep only the lower-panel colors named by the top markers and expand each marker into an object-count bar.

Input structure
A black instruction strip sits above a non-black rectangular scene panel.  The strip contains one-cell markers
in the first column, and each marker color is a candidate object color in the lower panel.  The lower panel has
a unique dominant background color and scattered 4-connected foreground objects.

Rule
In the lower panel, preserve objects whose colors appear as top markers and recolor every other foreground
object to the panel background.  In the instruction strip, replace each marker by a horizontal run from column 0
whose length is the number of 4-connected lower-panel objects of that marker color; erase markers with count 0.

Key insight
The top strip is a color filter plus a compact count summary: marker colors select which lower-panel objects
survive, and their bars report the number of surviving objects by color.

Erase the first border pixel hit by extending the red marker away from its pink trail.

Input structure
- The dominant background surrounds a unique red marker and a four-pixel
  pink trail.
- The pink pixels form one straight 8-connected ray starting next to the
  red marker.
- In the opposite direction from that trail, the red marker faces a
  non-background border or obstacle pixel beyond background cells.

Rule
- Keep the whole grid fixed except for the first non-background pixel on
  the ray from the red marker away from the pink trail.
- Recolor that one hit pixel to the background color.

Key insight
- The pink trail marks where the red marker came from, so the edit is found
  by ray-casting from the red marker in the opposite direction.

Recolor the large mask crop column-by-column using the separate three-row palette strip.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- One large monochrome foreground object is the mask; its bbox is the output region and may contain background holes.
- The remaining foreground is a 3-row palette rectangle with the same width as the mask bbox: two identical color rows and one uniform row.

Rule:
- Crop to the mask object's bbox.
- For each output column, color mask pixels with the corresponding color from the repeated palette rows.
- Replace background holes inside the crop with the palette's uniform third-row color.

Key insight:
The grey object is only a stencil; its columns select colors from the legend, while its holes expose the legend's fill color.

Rotate the colors around every 3x3 foreground ring, with corners and side-centers cycling in opposite directions.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Each 4-connected foreground object is a complete 3x3 ring: eight foreground pixels around a background center.

Rule
- For each ring, move corner colors one step around the four corners.
- Move side-center colors one step around the four side centers in the opposite direction.
- Leave the background center and all other background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Corners and side centers form two separate four-cycles on the same 3x3 ring.

Dock two-tone sprites into color-matched horizontal bars with a color swap.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top area: small two-tone sprites (outer color + inner color).
- Below: horizontal bars spanning most of the row, each with a fill color and border color on edges.

Rule:
- Match each sprite to the bar whose fill color equals the sprite's outer color.
- Place the sprite at its original x-position, aligned to the bar's bottom.
- Recolor: sprite outer → bar border, sprite inner → bar fill.
- Erase original sprites from the top area.

Key insight: Color matching is inverted — the sprite's dominant color identifies its target bar, then gets swapped to the bar's accent color.

Sort vertical bars by height and redistribute them across fixed colored slots.

Input structure:
- bg background; a horizontal base line of a single color spans the full grid width.
- Several monochrome vertical bars of distinct colors rise upward from the base line.

Rule:
- Rank bar shapes by height (shortest to tallest).
- Rank original x-positions (slots) left to right.
- Place the i-th shortest shape into the i-th leftmost slot, recoloring it to that slot's original color.
- The base line is preserved unchanged.

Key insight: Each slot keeps its x-position and color identity; only the bar silhouettes are redistributed among slots by height order.

Align a central rectangle to two colored frame-edge controls via rotation/reflection.

Input structure:
- bg grid with two solid-colored border edges (distinct non-bg colors).
- A central filled rectangle with 1px colored guide edges on two sides, colors matching the frame controls.

Rule:
- Rotate/mirror the object so its guide edges face the same sides as the matching frame controls.
- Crop off the 1px guide edges from aligned sides.

Key insight: Guide-edge colors encode target frame sides; the correct dihedral transform matches both simultaneously.

<description>
Infer the background, rotate the whole input 90 degrees counterclockwise, and stack two framed copies vertically.

Input structure:
- Blue is absent from the input.
- One rare marker color appears in exactly two pixels.
- The background is the unique non-marker color whose removal leaves exactly two 4-connected foreground objects, each with one marker pixel and one body color.
- The whole grid, including background and foreground objects, is the sprite to transform.

Rule:
- Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Create a blue one-pixel frame around two vertical copies of the rotated grid.
- Use the input background color for the two endpoints of every horizontal frame/separator row.

Key insight: The output is not a crop of the foreground objects; it is two copies of the complete rotated input, separated and enclosed by a newly added blue border.

Keep the larger sprite from each separated panel and overlay those sprites into one 5x5 canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a 5x17 grid: three 5x5 panels separated by one-cell black columns.
- Each panel has the same background color and exactly one foreground color split into two 4-connected components.

Rule:
- In each panel, discard the smaller foreground component and keep the unique largest component as the sprite.
- Process panels left to right, placing each sprite at its panel coordinates on a 5x5 background canvas.
- If a sprite would cover an already placed sprite, slide it by the unique nearest in-bounds offset that avoids overlap.

Key insight:
- The extra same-colored component in each panel is a distractor; the final answer is the non-overlapping overlay of the three largest components.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
