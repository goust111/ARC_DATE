<description>
Drop the moving-color objects downward until they rest above a one-row cushion before the obstacle or bottom edge.

Input structure:
- The grid has exactly three colors: empty background, a stationary obstacle/floor color, and a moving object color.
- The obstacle color is the unique non-background role that touches the bottom edge.
- Moving pixels start outside the obstacle cells, outside the row directly above each obstacle pixel, and outside the bottom row.

Rule:
- Keep the background and obstacle pixels fixed.
- Treat obstacle pixels, cells directly above obstacle pixels, and the bottom row as blocked.
- Repeatedly move every 4-connected moving-color object one row down when its translated shape does not hit blocked cells or another moving object.

Key insight: The visible floor has an invisible one-row cushion above it, so the objects fall under gravity but stop with one empty row before the floor or the grid bottom.

Dock train sprites onto station groups by matching coupler count, then orient via divider-color markers.

Input structure:
- bg; colored stripes (edge + internal) partition grid into rectangular regions.
- Color 8 forms train bodies; color 9 marks both isolated stations and train-attached couplers.
- Stripe-colored pixels on trains are orientation markers.

Rule:
- Stations = 8-connected 9-clusters not adjacent to any 8. Trains = components containing 8.
- Match train to station group where |couplers| == |station size|.
- Rotate/flip train so marker pixels face the same-color boundary stripe of the target region.
- Translate so couplers align exactly onto station cells; erase original position.

Key insight: Coupler count selects the docking target; marker color encodes which boundary stripe to face, fixing the unique orientation.

Reorder the vertical color-major blocks while preserving every block's internal pixels.

Input structure
The grid is divided into vertical blocks, each with a unique dominant color.
Small marker pixels from other block colors may appear inside the blocks.

Rule
If adjacent shared-color marker rows read exactly as the current block order
from right to left, reverse the blocks. Otherwise move the leftmost block to
the far right and shift the remaining blocks left.

Key insight
The transformation acts on whole vertical blocks, so marker pixels move with
their source block instead of being recolored or independently rearranged.

<description>
Detect thin '+' shapes in a single foreground color and recolor them to teal.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One foreground color (e.g. yellow) forms various shapes on the bg, some of which are small '+' crosses.

Rule:
- A '+' center is any foreground pixel whose 4 orthogonal neighbors are also foreground.
- Recolor each such center and its 4 neighbors to teal (8).
- All other pixels remain unchanged.

Key insight: Only compact 5-cell crosses qualify — a pixel embedded in a larger filled region also satisfies the neighbor check, so the rule highlights every local '+' motif, not just isolated ones.

<description>
Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

Slide each blue/teal or yellow/orange row pair together while preserving its left-to-right order.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background.
- Each nonempty row contains exactly two distinct foreground pixels.
- Blue/teal and yellow/orange row pairs are the moving pairs; other color pairs are distractors.

Rule
- For each moving pair, keep the left pixel fixed and move the right pixel left until it touches the left pixel.
- Clear the moved pixel's original location, and leave non-moving rows unchanged.

Key insight
- Only same-hue-family pixel pairs attract horizontally; separated unrelated colors do not compact.

Complete a sparse grid by casting occluding diagonal rays from the longest run and filling the remaining diagonal-connected regions from the short bars.

Input structure
- Black-background grid with one unique longest 4-connected foreground object.
- The longest object is a horizontal or vertical multicolor run; all other foreground objects are shorter monochrome bars.

Rule
- On a blank canvas, process the longest run from left to right or top to bottom; each pixel emits four 45-degree rays that stop at the first already-painted pixel.
- Each remaining monochrome bar fills every still-blank pixel reachable from it by diagonal steps.

Key insight
- Earlier pixels in the long run occlude later diagonal rays, and those ray barriers partition the background into diagonal-connected regions for the short bars.

Move bordered containers toward same-colored destination markers, charging gray cells to orange.

Input structure:
- bg = 6 (magenta). Black-bordered (0) rectangles with gray (5) / orange (7) interiors.
- A head sprite (9) sits adjacent to one container edge; a matching destination sprite lies along the movement axis.

Rule:
- Each container translates toward its destination along the head-to-dest axis.
- Steps = min(head-to-dest distance, number of gray interior cells).
- Gray cells become orange from the head-facing side inward, one per step.

Key insight: Gray cell count caps movement — a container stops short if it runs out of gray cells to charge.

<description>
Mark the missing center of each plus-shaped arrangement of four two-pixel bars with yellow.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The single foreground color forms isolated 4-connected objects, each a horizontal or vertical two-pixel bar.
- Some bars form an implied plus sign: two horizontal bars and two vertical bars around an empty center, with a one-pixel gap between the center and each bar.

Rule:
- Keep the input unchanged except at implied plus-sign centers.
- For every background pixel with foreground bars at offsets 2-3 cells left, right, above, and below, recolor that center yellow.
- The one-pixel gaps immediately next to the center in the four cardinal directions must remain background.

Key insight:
- The yellow pixels are not extending a line; they identify the shared missing center where four separated two-pixel bars align as a plus sign.

Simulate water falling from top-edge sources, pooling on shelves, and cascading off edges.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; water = rarest non-bg; shelf = other non-bg.
- Sources: water clusters touching top row. Shelves: horizontal segments.

Rule:
- Water falls down from sources, painting bg cells as water.
- On hitting a shelf, it spreads across the shelf span plus one cell past each end.
- From those overflow positions, water resumes falling independently.

Key insight: Each shelf splits a stream into two at its edges, creating a branching waterfall tree.

Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Paint the teal outline of the right triangle determined by the missing corner of the grey-marker square.

Input structure
The grid is an orange background with exactly four foreground marker pixels of one color. The markers have a square bounding box: three markers are bbox corners, and the fourth marker is inside that square.
Rule
Find the one corner of the marker bounding square that has no marker. That missing corner is the right-angle vertex of a right isosceles triangle; paint its two axis-aligned legs and the opposite diagonal in teal, leaving existing marker pixels unchanged.
Key insight
The present corner marker opposite the missing corner is a decoy; the three triangle vertices are the missing corner and the two marker corners adjacent to it.

Extend each colored domino marker into a full row or column bar, with horizontal bars covering vertical bars at crossings.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Every foreground object is a 4-connected same-color domino of exactly two pixels.
- A horizontal domino marks a row to paint; a vertical domino marks a column to paint.

Rule:
- Paint each marked column entirely with the color of its vertical domino marker.
- Paint each marked row entirely with the color of its horizontal domino marker.
- Rows are painted after columns, so row bars overwrite column bars at intersections.

Key insight:
- The two-pixel orientation is the instruction: horizontal markers emit row bars, vertical markers emit column bars, and the only layering cue is row-over-column.

Slide each inner colored object horizontally into the same-colored vertical wall until it touches an obstacle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are two non-background colors.
- One foreground color fills the left column and the other fills the right column.
- Extra 8-connected objects of each wall color appear away from that color's wall.

Rule
- Clear the extra objects from their original positions.
- For each wall color, process its 8-connected extra objects from nearest to farthest from the matching wall.
- Slide each object horizontally toward its matching wall as far as possible without overlapping the wall or an already settled object of the same color.
- Keep the two vertical wall columns fixed.

Key insight
- The side columns act like color-specific gravity walls: same-colored objects compact sideways against their own wall while preserving each object's shape.

Recolor wall-separated background regions alternately, starting with grey in the lower-left region.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground wall color.
- The wall pixels form one or more 4-connected one-cell-thick segments.
- Each wall segment separates exactly two 4-connected background regions.
Rule
- Keep all wall pixels unchanged.
- Label the 4-connected background regions and connect two labels when they
  touch opposite sides of the same wall segment.
- Color the region containing the lower-left corner grey, then flip between
  grey and green across every wall adjacency.
Key insight
- The red walls define a bipartite map of regions; the lower-left background
  region fixes which side of the alternating coloring is grey.

Extract the color of each noisy block in a row/column lattice and mirror the coarse grid horizontally.

Input structure:
- A background surrounds a rectangular lattice of monochrome foreground blocks.
- Consecutive rows in a lattice band share the same set of visible foreground colors.
- Consecutive columns in a lattice band share the same set of visible foreground colors.
- Each row-band/column-band intersection has one foreground color, with possible background holes.

Rule:
- Group non-empty rows and columns into consecutive bands by their foreground color sets.
- Replace each lattice cell by the single foreground color inside that row/column-band intersection.
- Return the resulting coarse color grid with the column order reversed.

Key insight:
- Whole-row and whole-column color sets reveal the hidden lattice even when neighboring cells share a color or contain holes.

Move colored sprites from the left strip into a framed area at marker-defined targets.

Input structure:
- bg background; rectangular frame on right with colored markers on its edges; sprites in a narrow left strip separated by a constant-color divider column.

Rule:
- For each color, target rows/cols are where both opposite frame edges share that color. Targets are the Cartesian product.
- Erase each sprite from the left and stamp it centered at every target. Higher sprites cover lower ones.

Key insight: One sprite replicates to a grid of row × column marker intersections.

Assemble colored sprites into a central bar's notches, chaining successive pieces along fixed-width strips.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Largest monochrome component is a solid "bar" with boundary notches (bg holes opening to its bbox edge).
- Several smaller colored sprites scattered around the bar.

Rule:
- Each bar notch is filled by a root piece whose shape exactly covers the hole.
- The root defines a strip (column-span or row-span) for its chain.
- Successive pieces fill the bg cells inside the previous piece's bbox, locked to the same strip width.
- Multiple chains grow independently from different bar notches.

Key insight: The root piece's extent perpendicular to the chain direction locks the strip width for all subsequent pieces in that chain.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
