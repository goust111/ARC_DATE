<description>
Composite two pattern tiles into a fourth panel using flood-fill from an indicator pixel.

Input structure:
- Four 5×5 panels in one row, border-separated.
- Panel 0: cue pixels = wall boundary (8-connected, edge-to-edge, through center)
           + one 8-isolated indicator pixel.
- Panels 1–2: source patterns. Panel 3: blank (to fill).

Rule:
- Flood-fill (4-conn) from indicator, blocked by wall → inside region.
- Inside → non-bg from panel 1; outside → non-bg from panel 2.
- Wall → panel 1 if non-bg; panel 2 fallback when wall is 4-connected.

Key insight: The cue panel's isolated indicator and wall partition the tile into inside/outside masks that select between the two source panels.

Recover the repeating background pattern hidden under the largest solid rectangle.

Input structure:
- The grid is covered by a small row/column periodic pattern.
- Several non-pattern colors form solid rectangular foreground objects that
  overwrite the pattern.
- The requested output region is the largest of those solid rectangles.

Rule:
- Find every 4-connected monochromatic object whose bounding box is a filled
  rectangle with both dimensions greater than one.
- Treat those rectangles as masks, infer the smallest repeating tile that is
  consistent with all remaining visible pixels, and repaint the largest
  rectangle's coordinates with that tile.

Key insight: The rectangle colors are occluders; the visible pixels outside
them are enough to reconstruct the original periodic background underneath.

Copy each foreground object anchored in a true grid corner clockwise into the next corner.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Foreground objects are monochromatic 4-connected components.
- Relevant objects are exactly those whose bounding box touches two adjacent borders at one grid corner.

Rule
- Start from the input unchanged.
- For each corner object, copy its pixel mask and color to the next corner clockwise: top-left to top-right, top-right to bottom-right, bottom-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-left.
- Preserve each object's orientation by aligning its bounding box to the destination corner; stamps may overwrite existing pixels at the destination, but source pixels are not cleared.

Key insight
- Interior and side-only objects are distractors; only components actually anchored to a corner participate in the clockwise perimeter copy.

Move every foreground object straight downward by a number of rows equal to its own pixel count.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- The foreground is made of separated 4-connected monochromatic objects.
- Objects may move partly below the bottom edge of the grid.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- For each foreground object, compute its area in pixels.
- Redraw the object at the same columns and that many rows lower, clipping pixels below the grid.

Key insight:
- The downward displacement is the object's own area; color and shape only identify which pixels move together.

Move bordered 5×5 squares to their designated grid edges by border color.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Azure (8) and red (2) bordered 5×5 squares with colored interiors, scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Azure squares → left edge (col 0); red squares → right edge (col W−5).
- Each square keeps its original row.
- Process azure left-to-right, red right-to-left (nearest-to-edge first).
- If a square's rows overlap an already-placed edge square, place it one square-width inward instead.

Key insight: Near-edge-first ordering plus row-overlap determines which square sits at the edge vs. the second column.

Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Convert each hollow 3x3 symbol to one pixel and slide the pixels clockwise from the marked edge.

Input structure
- The grid has a background, one full-edge marker line, and monochrome hollow 3x3 foreground symbols.
- The symbols lie on a coarse row/column lattice; fully empty lattice rows or columns are absent from the output.

Rule
- Replace each hollow 3x3 symbol with one pixel of its color in the corresponding coarse-grid cell.
- The marker edge gives the compaction direction by clockwise border travel: top -> right, right -> down, bottom -> left, left -> up.
- Preserve the order of non-background pixels while sliding them as far as possible in that direction.

Key insight
- The large picture is a scaled symbolic grid, and the blue edge marker acts as a gravity direction rather than as output content.

Drop the moving-color objects downward until they rest above a one-row cushion before the obstacle or bottom edge.

Input structure:
- The grid has exactly three colors: empty background, a stationary obstacle/floor color, and a moving object color.
- The obstacle color is the unique non-background role that touches the bottom edge.
- Moving pixels start outside the obstacle cells, outside the row directly above each obstacle pixel, and outside the bottom row.

Rule:
- Keep the background and obstacle pixels fixed.
- Treat obstacle pixels, cells directly above obstacle pixels, and the bottom row as blocked.
- Repeatedly move every 4-connected moving-color object one row down when its translated shape does not hit blocked cells or another moving object.

Key insight: The visible floor has an invisible one-row cushion above it, so the objects fall under gravity but stop with one empty row before the floor or the grid bottom.

Extract the color of each noisy block in a row/column lattice and mirror the coarse grid horizontally.

Input structure:
- A background surrounds a rectangular lattice of monochrome foreground blocks.
- Consecutive rows in a lattice band share the same set of visible foreground colors.
- Consecutive columns in a lattice band share the same set of visible foreground colors.
- Each row-band/column-band intersection has one foreground color, with possible background holes.

Rule:
- Group non-empty rows and columns into consecutive bands by their foreground color sets.
- Replace each lattice cell by the single foreground color inside that row/column-band intersection.
- Return the resulting coarse color grid with the column order reversed.

Key insight:
- Whole-row and whole-column color sets reveal the hidden lattice even when neighboring cells share a color or contain holes.

Expand the sparse dot lattice into a 26x26 drawing with thick bars between adjacent matching dots.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground pixels lie on logical rows and columns separated by background spacer rows/columns.
- A logical row or column is present when it contains at least one foreground pixel.

Rule
- Expand every background spacer row/column to thickness 2.
- Expand the logical rows/columns equally so the full output is 26x26.
- Paint each foreground logical pixel as a solid rectangle of its color.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels horizontally through the intervening spacer.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels vertically only when neither endpoint is part of a horizontal same-color run.

Key insight
- The input is a sampled line drawing: horizontal same-color runs define the bars first, and only unclaimed same-color vertical neighbors are joined.

Convert a rough nested line drawing into a clean canonical frame-and-dot diagram.

Input structure:
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Foreground 4-connected objects are rough closed frames or small filled blobs.
- Frames may contain other frames/blobs; blobs outside a frame remain outside it.

Rule:
- Detect the containment tree of foreground objects using holes of each frame object.
- Replace every blob with one foreground pixel.
- Replace every frame with a rectangular border padded two cells around its direct children.
- Place siblings by their original row/column overlap and order, with one empty cell between canonical objects.

Key insight: The exact wobbly geometry is irrelevant; only enclosure plus relative sibling positions define the output.

Extract the central object from the marker cluster whose markers have the same color.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background and several clusters; each cluster has four
same-color corner marker objects around one central monochromatic object.
Rule
Find every central object enclosed by four aligned corner markers of one color,
then choose the unique one whose object color equals the marker color.
Key insight
The answer is not the largest or most frequent object; it is the center of the
self-colored cluster, cropped to that object's bounding box with background kept.

Replace a corner L with a same-color right-triangle outline in the corresponding corner of an enlarged canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a square grid with one background color and one foreground color.
- The foreground is a one-pixel-thick L inside a square bbox.
- The L touches exactly one horizontal grid edge and one vertical grid edge, identifying a corner.

Rule:
- Fill a square output canvas of side 3n-2, where n is the input side length, with the background color.
- Double the L leg length to get the triangle side length.
- Draw the two perpendicular triangle legs on the same output corner edges and connect their free endpoints with the diagonal.

Key insight:
- The input L encodes the corner, color, and side length of the triangle outline; the missing side is the diagonal between the L's two free endpoints.

Project maroon markers into adjacent grey or pink 3x3 squares, erasing grey squares afterward.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, solid 3x3 grey and/or pink squares, and maroon marker pixels or segments directly touching one side of exactly one square.
Rule
Grey squares are erased; their adjacent maroon markers stay in place and stamp the nearest edge cell inside the grey square. Pink squares stay pink; their adjacent maroon markers disappear and stamp the corresponding cell on the square's middle row or middle column.
Key insight
The side touched by a marker determines the projection: grey uses the near edge, while pink uses the centerline, preserving the marker's coordinate along that side.

Move each gray marker along its green path until it reaches the cell next to a black-green-black gate, erasing the path behind it.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground components are made from a path color, a paired gate-end color, and single marker pixels.
- A gate is a straight end-center-end motif whose center has the path color and whose two ends share the gate-end color.

Rule:
- In every 4-connected foreground component with exactly one marker and one gate, erase the marker and all path-color pixels except the gate center.
- Place the marker on the unique path-color pixel adjacent to the gate center but not between the two gate ends.
- Components without both a marker and a gate stay unchanged.

Key insight: The black-green-black motif marks the stopping gate; the gray marker consumes the connected green path until it rests on the path cell immediately beside that gate.

Repeat the bottom foreground motif upward until it fills the whole grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground pixels occupy a contiguous block of rows at the bottom.
- That bottom block is the complete vertical motif, including its background cells.

Rule
- Copy the bottom motif rows repeatedly upward across the full grid.
- Preserve horizontal alignment and vertical phase: the original first motif row remains at its input row.
- The output shape is unchanged.

Key insight
The blank rows above the bottom foreground block are missing repetitions of the same row motif, not empty space.

Complete each partial marker mask by stamping the matching multicolor sprite over it.

Input structure
- A dominant background contains one or more 8-connected multicolor sprites.
- Separate target masks use colors that already occur inside one of those sprites.
- A target mask may contain only one marker pixel or several same-alignment marker pixels.

Rule
- For each multicolor sprite, test every translation that aligns a target pixel with a
  same-color sprite pixel.
- Keep the translations with maximal exact overlap against the existing target pixels,
  rejecting translations that conflict with other foreground or overlap a source sprite.
- Stamp the whole sprite at those translations; if a non-marker sprite color occurs as
  a single source pixel, consume that source-only marker back to background.

Key insight
The scattered target pixels are partial copies: their same-color overlap with a sprite
determines where the full sprite must be completed.

Slide black shapes rightward to a grey separator, then shoot red rays from enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- A vertical grey (5) separator column divides the grid into left and right halves.
- Black shapes sit on the left side against a background color (bg).

Rule:
- Translate each black connected component rightward until its right edge is flush with the separator.
- After sliding, find enclosed bg regions (holes) within the black shapes that touch the column just left of the separator.
- For each row spanned by such a hole, emit a red ray across the entire right half of the grid.

Key insight: Only holes adjacent to the separator trigger rays — the sliding creates enclosures that act as "nozzles" projecting rightward.

Replace the outlined object with the outside contour of that outline in the marker color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background surrounds one 8-connected foreground outline.
- The outline is the unique largest foreground color.
- One or more smaller interior colors are inside the outline; the marker color
  is the unique smallest non-outline color.

Rule:
- Erase all original foreground pixels to background.
- Paint every background pixel that is 4-adjacent to the outline with the
  marker color.
- Keep the grid shape unchanged.

Key insight: The colored interior marker supplies the paint color, while the
largest outline supplies only the contour whose outside edge is traced.

Compress the stacked colored bars into a compact ordered table with the control pixel on the selected row.

Input structure
- A background grid contains several full-width colored bars from top to
  bottom; the last bar is the base/separator color.
- Each non-base bar may have an aligned three-column comb motif below it,
  alternating side-pair rows with solid rows.
- A singleton control pixel sits away from the colored motifs.

Rule
- Make one output row per non-base bar, preserving top-to-bottom order.
- In that row, paint the bar color once for each solid three-pixel row in
  its motif, then paint the base-bar color in the separator column.
- The singleton control pixel sits immediately above the base bar. Among
  motifs whose open side-pair parity is compatible with that bottom row,
  put the control pixel in the output row with the fewest solid rows; use
  horizontal distance to the motif center only to break count ties.

Key insight
- The vertical comb height is a count, while the control pixel is read by
  projecting it onto the center gap of compatible comb rows rather than by
  its vertical band alone.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
