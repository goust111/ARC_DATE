Paint an inner border around the region reachable from a corner marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; wall color (blue) forms barriers dividing the grid.
- A unique single pixel (magenta) sits on one corner — the start marker.
- Some wall-colored pixels are structural (border-touching, enclosing regions); others are decorations.

Rule:
- Flood-fill from the marker corner to find all reachable bg cells, blocked by structural walls.
- Erase wall-colored decorations hidden behind structural walls (not reachable from marker side).
- Paint orange (color 7) on every reachable bg cell adjacent to a wall or grid edge — forming a 1-cell inner border.

Key insight: Only border-connected wall components act as real barriers; interior wall fragments are decorations to be removed.

Shift each interior pixel whose color matches a frame side one cell toward that matching side.

Input structure
The grid has a one-cell-thick rectangular frame: the four corners are the
background color, and each side between corners is a solid, distinct side
color. The interior is mostly background with sparse foreground pixels.

Rule
Interior pixels with the top-side color move one row up, bottom-side color
move one row down, left-side color move one column left, and right-side color
move one column right. A pixel already adjacent to its matching side stays in
place; colors that do not match a frame side and the frame itself are unchanged.

Key insight
The colored frame sides act as direction labels for matching interior pixels.

Fill the small background compartments bounded by the long contour color.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and two foreground colors.
- The more frequent foreground color forms long 8-connected contour fragments.
- The other foreground color is a fixed distractor/obstacle color that partitions
  the background but is never recolored.

Rule:
- Split the background into 4-connected regions using all foreground pixels as
  barriers.
- Keep the two largest background regions as the outside of the contour drawing.
- Recolor every other background region that touches a long contour component
  to the contour color; leave all foreground pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The apparent area fill is exactly a component-level fill of bounded background
compartments, not a row-wise interpolation between individual contour pixels.

Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Fill every row from the nearest marked horizontal bar, turning bar rows and color-boundary ties into separator rows.

Input structure
- A dominant background fills the grid except for full-width horizontal bars and one vertical marker column.
- Outside the marker column, every row is monochrome: either background or a source bar color.
- Background rows share one marker color in the marker column; source bar rows share the other.

Rule
- Each non-source row takes the color of the nearest source bar, with that row's marker-column pixel set to the source-marker color.
- If a row is exactly midway between nearest bars of different colors, make the whole row the source-marker color.
- Each original source bar row becomes a source-marker row with the marker-column pixel changed to the background-row marker color.

Key insight
- The marked bars are horizontal seeds for a one-dimensional nearest-seed partition over rows; equal-distance rows are separators only when the competing seed colors differ.

<description>
Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Rotate each vertical bar's color one slot right and its height one slot left.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds several monochrome one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Every bar is bottom-aligned and occupies a distinct column.
- The ordered bar slots are read from left to right.

Rule
- Keep the grid shape and the bar columns unchanged.
- At slot i, use the color from the previous slot cyclically.
- At slot i, use the height from the next slot cyclically.

Key insight
- Color and height are independent cyclic attributes of the ordered bar slots:
  colors rotate right while heights rotate left.

Summarize the foreground line objects as ordered horizontal color stripes.

Input structure:
- A dominant background fills a rectangular grid.
- Each non-background color forms one contiguous one-cell-thick line segment.
- The line segments have distinct topmost rows, and there are at most five of
  them.

Rule:
- Sort the foreground colors by the topmost row occupied by their line
  segment.
- Create a 5x3 output filled with the background color.
- Place one solid 1x3 row for each foreground color, preserving that
  top-to-bottom order and padding any unused rows above with background.

Key insight: The exact line length and slope do not matter; only the
vertical order of the colored line segments is encoded in the output stack.

Draw a blue folded corner-to-corner route through the lone marker's column.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid filled with one background color.
- Exactly one non-background marker pixel; blue is absent from the input.

Rule:
- Preserve the marker and repaint background pixels in its column blue from top to bottom.
- If the marker is in the unique center column, connect that column to the top-right and bottom-left corners.
- Otherwise, connect the column to the top-left and bottom-right corners.

Key insight:
The marker's column is the route spine; its central vs off-center placement selects which opposite corner pair gets the horizontal edge segments.

Fire projectiles from 3-pixel triangle sprites; mark collisions with maroon or blue.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg 3-pixel sprites shaped as axis-aligned L's or diagonal V's.

Rule:
- Each triangle has an apex and an emission direction determined by its shape: L-shapes fire diagonally away from the missing corner; V-shapes fire along the axis away from the open side.
- A projectile lands exactly 5 cells from the apex in the emission direction.
- If it hits an existing sprite, that entire sprite is recolored to maroon (9).
- If two projectiles land on the same empty cell, that cell becomes blue (1); a lone projectile on empty bg paints maroon (9).

Key insight: The triangle's orientation encodes both direction and target; dual-projectile collisions on open bg produce blue, not maroon.

Convert each colored partitioned frame into a horizontal bar whose length is its number of enclosed regions.

Input structure:
- Black background with several axis-aligned colored line drawings.
- The line drawings are damaged by scattered pixels of one non-background noise color and by overlaps with other drawings.
- Each real drawing is a rectangular partitioned frame enclosing one or more background regions.

Rule:
- For each non-background color, reconstruct its horizontal and vertical wall segments from dense row/column evidence.
- Count the 4-connected background regions fully enclosed by those reconstructed walls.
- The color with no enclosed region is the noise/pad color.
- Sort drawing colors by enclosed-region count; equal counts are ordered by which reconstructed frame covers the other.

Key insight:
- The scattered color is not an object; it only pads the histogram, while each true object's room count is stable after rectilinear wall reconstruction.

Recolor the small defect bars on each shared-color object with the opposite panel color.

Input structure
- The grid contains two large panel colors and one shared object color.
- Each shared-color object is a mostly solid rectangle inside exactly one panel.
Rule
- Find the near-solid rectangular core of each object.
- Missing core pixels and one-cell protrusions define two-pixel bars perpendicular to the nearest core edge.
- Recolor those bars with the other panel color; leave all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The colors to add are not tied to numeric ids: each object's surrounding panel identifies the opposite panel color.

Move each vertical stream of pixels into a bottom-aligned centered pile.

Input structure
- A mostly background grid contains one or more vertical source columns of
  foreground pixels.
- Each source column has n^2 foreground pixels, and the top-to-bottom color
  sequence splits into monochrome groups of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Rule
- Clear the canvas to background.
- For each source column, read the foreground colors from top to bottom and
  rebuild them at the bottom below the same column as odd-width centered
  rows of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Key insight
- The scattered vertical pixels are falling grains; a square number of
  grains decomposes into the odd row widths of a centered pyramid.

Move the side-attached foreground object to the opposite wall, shear its lower rows inward, and paint the crossed floor cells.

Input structure:
- The top row is the upper background color and the bottom row is the
  floor color.
- A single non-background, non-floor object touches exactly one vertical
  grid edge and rests immediately above the first solid floor row.

Rule:
- Clear the source object to the upper background color.
- Repaint each object row on the opposite side: the first three relative
  rows keep the edge alignment, and each lower row shifts one more pixel
  inward from that side.
- On the first floor row, repaint the traversed side-to-object segment
  maroon, stopping just before the final outer bottom support pixel.

Key insight:
- The side of the source object gives the horizontal direction, while the
  row index inside the object gives the one-cell-per-row diagonal shear.

Decode a block-grid image by swapping each sprite-coded cell with a solid cell and each blank cell with the sprite.

Input structure
The grid is partitioned by black separator rows and columns into equal-size
square blocks. Each block is either a copy of one two-color sprite or a
uniform blank block of the sprite's minority color; grey pixels are erased
cells that act as wildcards.

Rule
Infer the repeated sprite from fully visible mixed-color blocks. Replace a
block matching that sprite, ignoring grey erasures, with a solid block of
the sprite's majority color. Replace a uniform blank block with the sprite.
Separator rows and columns, including grey erasures on them, become black.

Key insight
The small sprite is a block-level code for one macro-cell state, and the
uniform minority-color block is the other state; the output renders the
opposite code in each macro-cell while cleaning erased pixels.

Decode the colored 3x3 contour motif into a 16x16 periodic lattice with the motif stamped in maroon at the center.

Input structure:
- The grid is 6x6 with orange background and one non-orange color.
- The non-orange pixels have a tight 3x3 bbox containing one contour glyph.
- The glyph is one of the task's period-3 contour forms: plus, H, X, or four corners.

Rule:
- Decode the 3x3 glyph into the period-3 orange phase tile.
- Fill a black 16x16 canvas by repeating that orange phase tile.
- Tile the original 3x3 glyph 2x2 and recolor its true pixels to maroon in the centered 6x6 region.

Key insight:
- The colored object is not copied at its input location; it is a small contour code whose phase tells where orange appears in the repeated lattice.

Copy colored control-ray ports from one rectangular sprite orientation to every matching transformed sprite.

Input structure:
- bg is the most common color.
- Several dense 2-by-N or N-by-2 rectangular sprites are dihedral transforms of one template.
- Isolated single-pixel control markers sit on rays projected outward from the dominant long edge of some sprites.

Rule:
- For each sprite, the active edge is the long side whose cells have the strongest same-color majority.
- A control marker seen first along an outward ray from an active-edge cell assigns its color to that template cell.
- On every transformed sprite, draw that assigned color outward from the corresponding active-edge cell through bg cells until blocked or out of bounds.

Key insight:
- The marker positions are not absolute; they label cells of a shared rectangular template, then the labels follow each sprite's rotation/reflection.

Recover the bottom-to-top stacking order of overlaid rectangular color frames.

Input structure:
- The background is one color, and every foreground color is a one-cell-thick rectangular frame.
- Overlapping frame pixels show only the color of the frame that is highest at that location.

Rule:
- Reconstruct each frame as the border of the bounding box of its visible pixels.
- At every cell covered by multiple reconstructed frames, the visible frame color is above the other frames covering that cell.
- Return the unique bottom-to-top order of frame colors as a single-column grid.

Key insight:
The hidden parts of each frame do not need to be seen directly; the visible pixels reveal the full frame bbox, and overlap cells reveal the layer constraints.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
