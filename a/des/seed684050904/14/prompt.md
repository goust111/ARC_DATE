<description>
Propagate a repeating striped pattern from a yellow border segment toward the opposite edge, recoloring foreground objects on certain stripes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Foreground blobs of another color scattered in the interior.
- A short yellow (4) segment sits on one border edge.

Rule:
- From the yellow segment, march toward the opposite edge in steps of 2 cells, cycling colors Y, Y, G (4, 4, 3). The 1-cell gap between stripes is forced to bg.
- Yellow stripes paint only within the segment's span.
- Green stripes additionally recolor all non-bg pixels across the entire row/column to green.

Key insight: Green stripes act as a "flood" that recolors existing objects on the full row/column, while yellow stripes are confined to the segment span.

Complete outlined shapes and carry attached shadow pixels along their edges.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Each active color marks vertices of an 8-direction aligned outline.
- A start vertex can have adjacent non-bg, different-colored shadow pixels.
- Other colored pixels may be distractors unless they lie on valid drawable edges.

Rule:
- For each color, order its pixels by polar angle around their centroid to form a cycle.
- Draw only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree edges whose interiors are clear.
- From the chosen start vertex, copy adjacent shadow offsets along each drawable edge
  when the parallel path is in bounds and clear.

Key insight: The main outline is reconstructed first, then the start vertex's neighbor offsets define parallel shadow strokes.

Complete the scene by adding the point-reflected copy of the colored object across the central marker.

Input structure
- The grid has odd dimensions, a dominant background, and a center-row marker color appearing only at the left edge, center, and right edge.
- A single divider color fills the center column except for the center marker.
- All remaining foreground pixels form the object to copy, entirely on the left side of the divider.
Rule
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For every object pixel, paint the pixel rotated 180 degrees around the center marker with the same color.
Key insight
- The center marker is the rotation center; the yellow-looking divider is not mirrored, it only separates the source from the empty target side.

Remove the left control column and roll the remaining image downward by the red marker's row.

Input structure
- The input is a rectangular grid with a one-cell-wide control column on the left.
- That control column is all pink except for exactly one red marker pixel.
- The columns to the right are the image that remains in the output.

Rule
- Delete the left control column.
- Let r be the row index of the red marker in that column.
- Cyclically shift the remaining image downward by r rows.

Key insight
- The red marker's vertical position encodes the row-roll amount; the pink
  column is only a control strip and is removed after reading it.

<description>
Connect framed squares via colored bridges following a control-pixel sequence.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Border color forms equal-sized framed squares with unique inner fill colors.
- Control row below squares: colored pixels read left-to-right encode visitation order.

Rule:
- Start at the square matching first control color c0.
- For each consecutive pair (ci, ci+1), find the ci+1-colored square aligned in the same row or column band, preferring nearest.
- Draw a bridge colored ci between the pair, spanning the gap with inner-square thickness.

Key insight: Row/column-band alignment plus proximity resolves ambiguity when inner colors repeat.

<description>
Move magenta particles along corridors formed by parallel colored bars.

Input structure:
- bg=7. Particles=6 in col 0. Colored bars on even rows form corridors on odd rows.

Rule:
- Particle goes straight through bg cells.
- When blocked by a colored cell, turns 90° into the perpendicular direction
  that has a bg cell flanked by same-color bars. Stops at grid edge or full blockage.

Key insight: Same-color parallel bars define the only valid corridors, so each particle follows a deterministic local trace.

<description>
Remove each fracture marker line and push the surrounding object pixels one cell away from it.

Input structure
- A background grid with 8-connected foreground objects made from a body color and a rarer marker color.
- Each object has a non-square bbox; the marker pixels form one complete fracture line across the shorter bbox axis.

Rule
- Erase all marker pixels.
- For a wide object, each row has one marker; body pixels left of it shift one cell left and body pixels right of it shift one cell right.
- For a tall object, each column has one marker; body pixels above it shift one cell up and body pixels below it shift one cell down.

Key insight
- The marker line is a crack through the object, so the two sides separate by one pixel perpendicular to the crack.

Draw the missing diagonal connector segment between each pair of same-color rectangular objects.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground color appears as exactly two separated solid rectangular 4-connected objects.
- The two rectangles of each color are diagonally offset with facing corners on a 45-degree line.

Rule:
- Keep all existing rectangles unchanged.
- For each foreground color, connect the lower facing corner of the upper rectangle to the upper facing corner of the lower rectangle.
- Paint only the intervening background pixels on that diagonal, excluding the two endpoint pixels already in the rectangles.

Key insight:
- Same-color rectangles define the endpoints; the output completes the open diagonal between their nearest facing corners.

<description>
Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

<description>
Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

Use the pink control pixel to choose where the maroon pixel belongs inside the grey 3x3 region, and turn the control pixel maroon.

Input structure:
- The grid contains one 3x3 region made from eight grey pixels and one maroon pixel.
- There is exactly one pink control pixel outside that region.

Rule:
- Restore the old maroon cell in the 3x3 region to grey.
- Compare the pink pixel to the 3x3 region: above/same band/below selects top/middle/bottom, and left/same band/right selects left/middle/right.
- Paint the selected cell maroon and recolor the pink control pixel maroon.

Key insight:
- The pink pixel acts as a relative-position marker for a 3x3 target inside the grey region.

Emit diagonal beams from framed 2x2 blocks through frame gaps; beams interact on collision.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall color (e.g. green) forms 4x4 frames around 2x2 monochrome blocks.
- Each frame has one or more gap pixels where the wall is missing.

Rule:
- Each gap emits a beam of the inner block's color, traveling diagonally outward (direction set by gap position relative to the block).
- Beams paint every cell they cross until they hit the grid edge or collide.
- 90° collision: both beams turn 45° toward their bisector direction; the intersection cell is left blank (1-pixel gap).
- 45° collision: beams merge into a zigzag (alternating cardinal + diagonal steps) with no gap at the meeting point.

Key insight: Two distinct collision rules — 90° produces a gap and single-pixel diagonal lines; 45° produces no gap and thicker zigzag bands.

Count the two upper quadrant control regions to size an output made from the lower quadrant pattern.

Input structure:
- The grid is an even square split into four equal quadrants.
- Black is the background.
- The upper-left and upper-right quadrants are control regions.
- The lower-left quadrant is a color source tile; the lower-right quadrant is either a stencil tile or empty.

Rule:
- Output height is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-left quadrant.
- Output width is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-right quadrant.
- If the lower-right stencil has foreground pixels, tile it over the output; each stencil background pixel is filled from the lower-left quadrant cell at the corresponding coarse tile position.
- If the lower-right stencil is empty, tile the lower-left quadrant directly over the output.

Key insight:
- The top quadrants specify only dimensions, while the bottom quadrants specify a two-level repeated pattern: a fine stencil and coarse fill colors.

Swap the upper two-pixel segment and the lower two-pixel segment around the fixed center pixel.

Input structure:
- The grid is a 5x1 vertical column of individual colored pixels.
- The middle pixel is a separator between two same-size two-pixel segments.

Rule:
- Keep the middle pixel in place.
- Reverse the order of the two pixels above the middle.
- Reverse the order of the two pixels below the middle.

Key insight:
- The transformation is local vertical order reversal on each side of the center, not a color-specific rule.

Recolor vertical bars by legend-driven rank selection.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Top-left: monochrome blocks touching row 0; each has color K and height k.
- Main grid: vertical bars capped top and bottom by a single color, with solid-color interiors.

Rule:
- For each legend entry (K, k), find vertical bars capped by K.
- Rank bars by interior length (longest = rank 1).
- Recolor the rank-k bar's interior to K.

Key insight: Legend height is a rank index into length-sorted bars, not a literal size.

Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Replace the active black cutout's tail with background and mark the cutout side facing a colored source region.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background, with black rectangle-plus-tail cutouts, one gray source region, and colored distractors.
- Non-gray colored regions and single pixels are distractors/blockers, even when they are multi-pixel staircase shapes.

Rule:
- Find each black cutout whose largest solid rectangle leaves exactly a two-pixel tail.
- The active gray source region is visible only by horizontal rays through background from a cutout's left or right side.
- Select the unique cutout side with the most same-source visible rows, erase that cutout's tail to background, and recolor the full selected vertical side pink (6).

Key insight:
- The colored regions do not move; their horizontal line-of-sight identifies which rectangular cutout is being opened and which side receives the pink mark.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Recolor each side-marked multicolor object embedded in a monochrome panel to its marker color.

Input structure:
- Same-color 4-connected components form monochrome panel regions.
- The bounding box of a panel may contain 4-connected non-panel-color objects.
- A target object touches exactly one side of its panel bbox, and all of its
  pixels on that side have one marker color.

Rule:
- For every target object, fill any panel-colored holes enclosed by the object.
- Recolor the object and filled holes to the side marker color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- A multicolor object's single contact side identifies both which object should
  be normalized and which color should replace it.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
