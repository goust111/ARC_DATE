Move each colored object vertically until it touches the matching top or bottom border bar.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The top row is a full-width bar in one foreground color and the bottom row is a full-width bar in another.
- All other foreground pixels are 8-connected monochrome objects whose color matches one of those bars.

Rule:
- Top-bar-colored objects move upward so their bbox top is row 1.
- Bottom-bar-colored objects move downward so their bbox bottom is the row above the bottom bar.
- A downward-moving one-column segment whose landing overlaps its source becomes the continuous vertical segment swept between them.

Key insight:
The horizontal bars are destination anchors: color determines which border an object slides toward, while columns and object shape are otherwise preserved.

Use the left-edge color legend to draw a padded rectangular halo around each matching object while preserving enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- One or more two-row markers sit on the left edge; each marker is a 2x2 block whose left column is an object color and right column is its halo color.
- Away from the markers, every source color from the legend appears as one or more 4-connected monochrome objects.

Rule:
- Keep the input pixels unchanged.
- For each source-color object, take its tight bbox expanded by one cell and clipped to the grid.
- Recolor background pixels in that expanded region to the marker's halo color, except for background holes enclosed by the object.

Key insight:
- The small left-edge bars are a legend: they map object colors to the colors used for the surrounding padded bbox.

Fill each vertical foreground band's background cells with the color of the next band to its right.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each other color occupies a separate vertical band defined by that color's
  minimum and maximum columns.
- Within a band, all cells are either that band's color or background.

Rule
- Order the bands from left to right.
- In each band, replace background pixels with the color of the next band in
  that order, wrapping from the rightmost band back to the leftmost.
- Preserve all existing foreground pixels and all background pixels outside
  the bands.

Key insight
- The column bands form a cyclic palette legend: a band's gaps are completed
  by borrowing the color from its right-hand neighbor, not by changing the
  band's existing pixels.

Attach monochrome sprites to the matching sides of a central hollow square.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A hollow NxN square (hub) with bg corners/interior and four differently-colored edges (top, bottom, left, right).
- 2-4 monochrome sprites scattered on the grid, each matching one hub edge color.

Rule:
- For each hub edge color, find the matching sprite outside the hub.
- Rotate the sprite (0/90/180/270°) so its contact edge has exactly N-2 contiguous cells aligned with the hub side, and the rotated sprite is mirror-symmetric along the contact-edge axis (UD for left/right, LR for top/bottom).
- Translate it to adjoin that hub side. 
- Clear everything else to bg; output is hub + attached sprites only.

Key insight: Each edge color uniquely pairs a sprite to a side; symmetry along the contact-edge axis disambiguates the correct rotation.

Slide each blue/teal or yellow/orange row pair together while preserving its left-to-right order.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background.
- Each nonempty row contains exactly two distinct foreground pixels.
- Blue/teal and yellow/orange row pairs are the moving pairs; other color pairs are distractors.

Rule
- For each moving pair, keep the left pixel fixed and move the right pixel left until it touches the left pixel.
- Clear the moved pixel's original location, and leave non-moving rows unchanged.

Key insight
- Only same-hue-family pixel pairs attract horizontally; separated unrelated colors do not compact.

Move each isolated colored pixel into the one-cell frame around a grey 2x2 block.

Input structure:
- Background is the dominant color.
- Grey foreground objects are solid 2x2 anchor blocks.
- Every other non-background, non-grey cell is a colored singleton source.

Rule:
- Keep the grey anchors fixed and clear all colored singleton source pixels.
- For each singleton and each anchor, the normal destination is the cell reached by
  clamping the pixel into the anchor's one-cell outer frame.
- If a diagonally outside singleton has an exact 8-direction sightline into an anchor,
  also allow the cell just before the first grey pixel on that ray.
- Choose distinct destinations that minimize total king-move distance; at equal
  distance prefer exact sightlines, then the shorter Manhattan movement.

Key insight: The grey 2x2 blocks define magnetic frames; conflicts are resolved
structurally by nearest-frame assignment rather than by color identity.

Extend a green path from one grid edge to the opposite, routing around red bars at a distance dictated by their blue pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg = azure (8). Red/blue bars (color 2/1) act as obstacles.
- A single green (3) pixel sits on a grid border — the path start.

Rule:
- Each bar's keep-out radius equals its number of blue pixels; the path must stay farther than that from every bar cell.
- The green pixel extends inward toward the opposite edge, turning at right angles to navigate around forbidden zones.
- After the path is drawn, all blue pixels become red.

Key insight: Blue pixels on a bar encode its danger radius — more blue means a wider no-go zone the path must respect.

Erase the top palette row and redraw it below as a widening wedge centered on its missing cell.

Input structure
- The top row is a palette row with exactly one background gap.
- Below it, the only foreground is one vertical marker bar of a single color.
- The marker bar is either in the gap column or immediately beside it.

Rule
- Clear the grid to background.
- Starting at the top of the marker bar, each next row copies one more
  column of the top-row palette on both sides of the gap.
- Fill the gap column with the marker color, and keep the vertical marker bar.

Key insight
- The lone background cell in the top row is the center of the expanding
  copy; the lower vertical bar provides the center color and the row where
  the expansion begins.

Erase each target-color object crossed by the ray pointed by the bar-and-control marker.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is one three-pixel straight marker bar and one singleton control pixel adjacent to the bar center.
- The remaining non-background color forms multiple 4-connected target objects.

Rule:
- Cast a straight ray from the marker bar center in the direction away from the adjacent control pixel.
- Find every 4-connected target-color object that intersects that ray.
- Recolor all pixels of those hit target objects to the background; all other pixels stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- The whole object is erased when the center ray touches any of its pixels; the full marker bar width is not swept.

Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Paint a recolored diagonal copy from each L triomino source object.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground objects are 4-connected red and grey L triominoes,
  each occupying three pixels of a 2x2 box.

Rule:
- Grey L objects paint a yellow copy translated one diagonal step toward
  their missing 2x2 corner.
- Red L objects paint a green copy translated one diagonal step away from
  their missing 2x2 corner.
- Copies are clipped by the grid boundary; red-derived green copies are
  painted after grey-derived yellow copies where the projections collide.

Key insight:
- The missing corner of each 2x2 L object identifies its diagonal axis, and
  the source color determines which side of that axis receives the copy.

Decode a block-grid image by swapping each sprite-coded cell with a solid cell and each blank cell with the sprite.

Input structure
The grid is partitioned by black separator rows and columns into equal-size
square blocks. Each block is either a copy of one two-color sprite or a
uniform blank block of the sprite's minority color; grey pixels are erased
cells that act as wildcards.

Rule
Infer the repeated sprite from fully visible mixed-color blocks. Replace a
block matching that sprite, ignoring grey erasures, with a solid block of
the sprite's majority color. Replace a uniform blank block with the sprite.
Separator rows and columns, including grey erasures on them, become black.

Key insight
The small sprite is a block-level code for one macro-cell state, and the
uniform minority-color block is the other state; the output renders the
opposite code in each macro-cell while cleaning erased pixels.

Extract the hidden two-color image by compacting the rows and columns of its complete mask.

Input structure
The grid contains one pair of colors whose pixels occupy every cell in the
cross product of their active rows and active columns; all other colors form
the surrounding filler or separators.
Rule
Find that unique color pair, keep exactly the rows and columns touched by
the pair, and return the induced subgrid.
Key insight
The target image is not chosen by color id; it is the only two-color mask
whose occupied pixels form a full rectangular row/column product after
deleting unused rows and columns.

Convert each hollow 3x3 symbol to one pixel and slide the pixels clockwise from the marked edge.

Input structure
- The grid has a background, one full-edge marker line, and monochrome hollow 3x3 foreground symbols.
- The symbols lie on a coarse row/column lattice; fully empty lattice rows or columns are absent from the output.

Rule
- Replace each hollow 3x3 symbol with one pixel of its color in the corresponding coarse-grid cell.
- The marker edge gives the compaction direction by clockwise border travel: top -> right, right -> down, bottom -> left, left -> up.
- Preserve the order of non-background pixels while sliding them as far as possible in that direction.

Key insight
- The large picture is a scaled symbolic grid, and the blue edge marker acts as a gravity direction rather than as output content.

Render the filled-square object counts as compact nested stacks ordered by count rank.

Input structure
A large noisy grid has a dominant background, scattered non-square noise, and
filled monochrome square objects. Each square side length has exactly one
object color, and side lengths form consecutive sizes.

Rule
Ignore non-square components. If the lowest square in the scene is of the
smallest side length, treat that one smallest square as a distractor and do
not count it. For count rank k from left to right, create one block from all
square sizes with at least k remaining objects; draw larger squares first and
smaller squares over their upper-left corner, then append one background
separator column.

Key insight
The output is a count histogram of square side lengths, but each histogram
slot is rendered as nested upper-left square masks using the side colors.

Crop a board cluster and rotate its color layers based on outside cue sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- A main multi-color board cluster (largest foreground region).
- Small monochrome cue sprites outside the board for the colors that rotate.

Rule:
- Tight-crop around the board cluster.
- For each color layer inside the crop, find its same-color cue outside.
- Rotate that layer clockwise by (cue pixel count mod 4) × 90°.
- No outside cue → no rotation.

Key insight: Cue sprite size mod 4 encodes rotation amount for its matching color layer.

Rebuild the foreground rectangles as a largest-to-smallest lower-left nesting.

Input structure
- A periodic wallpaper background is overlaid by foreground colors that each form a rectangular frame or solid rectangle.
- The largest foreground rectangle is the output frame; smaller foreground rectangles are the objects to nest inside it.
- A frame may be partially hidden by a smaller rectangle, but its visible pixels still determine its bbox.

Rule
- Ignore the wallpaper and crop the result to the largest foreground rectangle's bbox size.
- Sort foreground rectangles by bbox area from largest to smallest.
- Reconstruct each frame or solid rectangle, placing every next smaller rectangle in the lower-left of the current rectangle's usable region.

Key insight
- The scattered background colors are not objects; the meaningful order is the unique descending rectangle size chain, and each step nests into the previous rectangle's lower-left interior.

Fill the region enclosed by a wall sprite and radiate color outward through its opening.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall = most frequent non-bg color, forming a partial enclosure (e.g. U-shape).
- A fill-color pixel sits inside the enclosed area. Other non-bg pixels may act as obstacles.
Rule:
- Flood-fill the enclosed area with the fill color, radiating outward through the wall's open end.
- Obstacles cast "shadows" along the radiate direction, blocking fill behind them.

Key insight: The wall endpoints define the opening direction; fill radiates outward through it, and obstacles block propagation along that same axis.

Swap every sprite to the opposite prototype while preserving scale and position.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Two distinct small sprite patterns (prototypes) appear at various scales.
- Each sprite instance is a scaled copy of one of the two prototypes, placed on the grid.

Rule:
- Identify the two prototype patterns from the smallest-area sprites.
- For each sprite, determine which prototype it matches and its integer scale factor.
- Replace it with the other prototype at the same scale, aligned by an internal anchor region (color-1 pixels).

Key insight: Every sprite toggles to the alternate prototype; the anchor sub-region inside each sprite pins the alignment so swapped sprites land in the correct position regardless of scale.

Reorder the vertical color-major blocks while preserving every block's internal pixels.

Input structure
The grid is divided into vertical blocks, each with a unique dominant color.
Small marker pixels from other block colors may appear inside the blocks.

Rule
If adjacent shared-color marker rows read exactly as the current block order
from right to left, reverse the blocks. Otherwise move the leftmost block to
the far right and shift the remaining blocks left.

Key insight
The transformation acts on whole vertical blocks, so marker pixels move with
their source block instead of being recolored or independently rearranged.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
