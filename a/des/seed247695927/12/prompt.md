Swap paired marker pixels across the largest foreground-color barrier, placing them just outside the barrier segment.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color is the unique most frequent non-background color; its pixels form the stationary barrier.
- Other foreground pixels are single markers, sometimes paired on opposite sides of one contiguous barrier segment in the same row or column.

Rule:
- Scan each row and column that crosses exactly one contiguous barrier segment.
- If the line has exactly one marker on each side of that segment, erase both source markers and place each marker in the cell immediately beyond the opposite side of the segment.
- Lines with markers on only one side are unchanged; the barrier remains unchanged.

Key insight:
- The marker pairing is local to a row or column, and the destination is defined by the nearest cells outside the intervening barrier segment, not by the original distance from the barrier.

Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

Extend a green path from one grid edge to the opposite, routing around red bars at a distance dictated by their blue pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg = azure (8). Red/blue bars (color 2/1) act as obstacles.
- A single green (3) pixel sits on a grid border — the path start.

Rule:
- Each bar's keep-out radius equals its number of blue pixels; the path must stay farther than that from every bar cell.
- The green pixel extends inward toward the opposite edge, turning at right angles to navigate around forbidden zones.
- After the path is drawn, all blue pixels become red.

Key insight: Blue pixels on a bar encode its danger radius — more blue means a wider no-go zone the path must respect.

Slide the non-square sprite to the square anchor and replace the anchor with the sprite's mirror image.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- There is one 8-connected non-background sprite that is not a solid 2x2 square.
- There is one solid 2x2 square anchor in another non-background color.

Rule:
- Move the sprite straight toward the anchor along their unique cardinal separation until it touches the anchor's near edge.
- Reflect the moved sprite across that near edge and draw the reflected copy in the anchor color.
- Clear the original locations; the output keeps only the moved sprite and reflected anchor-color copy.

Key insight:
- The 2x2 square marks the mirror line: its side facing the sprite becomes the contact edge for a two-color reflected pair.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Recolor the two diagonal foreground-bar orientations, assigning teal to the larger orientation and red to the smaller one.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground color.
- Foreground pixels form one-cell-thick diagonal bars.
- Every foreground pixel belongs to exactly one diagonal orientation.

Rule
- Keep the background unchanged.
- Classify each foreground pixel by whether it has a diagonal neighbor on the NW/SE axis or the NE/SW axis.
- Recolor the orientation with more foreground pixels teal and the other orientation red.

Key insight
- The output colors depend on the relative population of the two diagonal orientations, not on a fixed slash direction or position.

Complete each partially hidden simple foreground shape by recoloring the occluding pixels in its footprint.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several solid foreground shapes.
- Some shapes are partially hidden by other foreground colors, but their full
  footprint is still indicated by a foreground-filled bbox or by a foreground-
  filled 45-degree diagonal line.

Rule
- For each foreground color, complete its full rectangular bbox when that bbox
  contains no background and includes other colors.
- Otherwise, complete its 45-degree diagonal line when all visible pixels lie
  on that line and the hidden line cells are foreground, not background.
- Recolor only those hidden footprint pixels; leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The occluded cells are exactly the non-background cells inside a simple
  shape's implied footprint, so completing shapes is a local recoloring problem.

Copy each foreground object anchored in a true grid corner clockwise into the next corner.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Foreground objects are monochromatic 4-connected components.
- Relevant objects are exactly those whose bounding box touches two adjacent borders at one grid corner.

Rule
- Start from the input unchanged.
- For each corner object, copy its pixel mask and color to the next corner clockwise: top-left to top-right, top-right to bottom-right, bottom-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-left.
- Preserve each object's orientation by aligning its bounding box to the destination corner; stamps may overwrite existing pixels at the destination, but source pixels are not cleared.

Key insight
- Interior and side-only objects are distractors; only components actually anchored to a corner participate in the clockwise perimeter copy.

Copy each marked sprite to every standalone marker of the same color and erase the original sources.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each source is an 8-connected component containing a monochrome sprite and one marker pixel of another color.
- Other isolated marker pixels may be destinations; marker colors with no source sprite are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the grid to background.
- For every source marker color, place the sprite at each other marker of that color using the source marker as the anchor.
- Keep each destination marker pixel in place; do not keep source sprites, source markers, or distractor markers.

Key insight:
- A colored marker is not part of the sprite geometry; it is the anchor that says where same-colored copies of that sprite should be stamped.

Move each teal-cornered filled rectangle one cell diagonally toward its teal corner.

Input structure:
- Dominant background surrounds several filled rectangular colored objects.
- Each object has exactly one teal control pixel replacing one corner cell of
  its rectangle.

Rule:
- Treat the teal pixel as the missing corner of its colored rectangle.
- Erase each original rectangle footprint, including the teal pixel.
- Repaint the completed rectangle shifted one cell diagonally in the direction
  of that teal corner.

Key insight:
- The control pixel's corner position gives both the missing cell to restore
  and the diagonal motion vector.

Build the woven rectangle determined by the two marked cells on each crossed bar.

Input structure
A black-background grid contains one long horizontal bar and one long vertical bar.
Each bar has a dominant base color and exactly two same-colored marker pixels.

Rule
The horizontal marker pair gives the output column span.  From the horizontal bar
row, walk toward the farther vertical marker; rows and columns alternate every
other cell.  Even step/even offset cells use the horizontal marker color until
the nearer vertical marker is reached, then use the vertical marker color.
Odd row steps use the horizontal base on marker columns and the original
crossing color on spacer columns.  Spacer columns on even row steps use the
vertical base, except at the switch row where they use the crossing color.

Key insight
The original cross cell records which base color wins at base/base lattice
crossings; the nearer vertical marker is the color-switch boundary.

Expand the top-left horizontal bar into a wrapped sequence of increasing and decreasing foreground runs.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background color and exactly one foreground color.
- All foreground pixels form one contiguous horizontal bar in the top row.
- The bar starts at the left edge; its length is the control value n.

Rule:
- Build a one-dimensional sequence of foreground runs with lengths
  1, 2, ..., n, n-1, ..., 2, 1.
- Separate adjacent runs by one background pixel.
- Wrap the sequence row-major across the input width and pad the final row
  with background pixels.

Key insight:
The output preserves the input width; the bar length controls the run-length
diamond, and the apparent 2D pattern is just that 1D sequence wrapped into rows.

Delete each foreign-color object whose bounding box is contained by a larger object of another color.

Input structure
- The black pixels are the empty canvas, and every other color forms one or more 8-connected monochromatic objects.
- Some larger foreground objects act as loose U/C-like containers around smaller objects of different colors.
Rule
- Find all 8-connected monochromatic non-black objects.
- Recolor an object to black exactly when its bounding box is contained in the bounding box of a larger object of another color.
- Keep all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The removable objects are identified by containment in another color's rectangular extent, not by their own color or shape.

Remove diagonal staircase noise and complete broken straight lines.

Input structure:
- bg = background; one foreground color fg forming axis-aligned lines.
- Some fg pixels form 45° diagonal chains (8-connected but 4-disconnected from lines).

Rule:
- Delete all diagonal-only fg pixels (those with no orthogonal fg neighbor, only diagonal ones).
- Fill short gaps in horizontal/vertical lines where a deleted diagonal was nearby.
- Prune remaining diagonal-adjacent leaf pixels near former diagonal sites.

Key insight: Diagonal pixels are hints marking where a straight line is broken; their span sets the maximum gap size to fill.

Move the closest reachable maroon pixels into the 3×3 block around the unique red center.

Input structure:
- bg = orange floor, magenta walls, scattered maroon (9) pixels.
- A unique red (2) pixel marks the center of a 3×3 destination block.

Rule:
- Maroon pixels connected to the destination through floor/maroon cells (not blocked by walls) are candidates.
- Rank candidates by distance to the destination; the closest ones fill the block in row-major order.
- Moved maroons are erased (replaced with floor color).

Key insight: Wall barriers restrict connectivity — only maroon pixels reachable via flood-fill through the floor qualify, so proximity alone isn't enough.

Connect framed squares via colored bridges following a control-pixel sequence.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Border color forms equal-sized framed squares with unique inner fill colors.
- Control row below squares: colored pixels read left-to-right encode visitation order.

Rule:
- Start at the square matching first control color c0.
- For each consecutive pair (ci, ci+1), find the ci+1-colored square aligned in the same row or column band, preferring nearest.
- Draw a bridge colored ci between the pair, spanning the gap with inner-square thickness.

Key insight: Row/column-band alignment plus proximity resolves ambiguity when inner colors repeat.

Replace an orange canvas with concentric Manhattan-distance color rings centered on the lone marker pixel.

Input structure:
- The grid is an orange background with exactly one non-orange marker pixel.
- The marker color is one of the colors in the fixed non-orange ring cycle.

Rule:
- The marker location is distance 0 and keeps the marker color.
- Each step of Manhattan distance away from the marker advances one position
  through the cycle green, yellow, black, grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, blue.
- Fill every pixel of the original grid by this distance-indexed cycle.

Key insight: The output is not copied from existing objects; it is the
distance field around the single marker, colored by a cyclic palette that
excludes the orange background.

Assemble scattered jigsaw sprites around a central yellow anchor by pairing red connector pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = black (0). Several colored sprites scattered on the grid.
- One anchor sprite contains a 3×3 yellow (4) block.
- Each sprite has red (2) connector pixels along its edges.

Rule:
- The anchor stays in place; remaining sprites attach one at a time.
- Each sprite is translated so that one of its red pixels overlaps an unpaired red pixel on the growing assembly.
- Every red connector must pair with exactly one other, forming a complete joined structure.

Key insight: Red pixels act as jigsaw pegs — each must match exactly one counterpart, and the assembly order is determined by which unpaired connectors remain.

Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
