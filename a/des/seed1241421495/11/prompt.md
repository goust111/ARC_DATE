Push every colored object touching maroon markers straight outward until it reaches the grid edge.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Maroon pixels are fixed markers.
- Every other foreground 4-connected object touches the marker pixels on exactly one cardinal side.

Rule:
- Clear each non-background, non-maroon object from its original position.
- Translate it in the direction away from its maroon contact until the object reaches the grid boundary.
- Keep the maroon marker pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The maroon contact side is a launcher: it determines a unique outward ray for the whole object, and the edge of the grid determines the translation distance.

Move each maroon marker toward the blue rectangle and recolor the rectangle red.

Input structure
A background canvas contains one solid blue rectangular object and several isolated
maroon marker pixels. Each marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the
rectangle and lies outside it.

Rule
Start with a background canvas, repaint the blue rectangle red, and move each
maroon marker straight toward the rectangle along its row or column. Exactly one
marker is strictly closer to the rectangle than all others and enters the
rectangle boundary; every other marker lands in the adjacent exterior cell just
outside its aligned side.

Key insight
The single entering marker is the unique global nearest marker to the rectangle,
not the nearest marker on each of the four sides.

Decode a stamp map: read templates, markers, and palette from a tiled grid, then render stamps.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into K tile columns (each N wide) separated by 1-col dashed separators.
- Top band (rows 0..N-1): K template masks, one per tile column.
- Middle band (rows N+1..2N): marker pixels whose color picks a template.
- Bottom band (rows 2N+2..): K palette swatches giving the output color per template.
- Separator rows at rows N and 2N+1 (dashed pattern of sep color).

Rule:
- Each marker's local position (lr, lc) within its tile column determines which N×N output block to stamp.
- The marker's color identifies which template to use; the palette recolors the template.

Key insight: Marker color encodes template index; local position within tile column encodes stamp block.

Repair noisy periodic patterns inside frame-delimited grid regions.

Input structure:
- Frame color (most common) forms full rows/cols, dividing the grid into rectangular regions.
- bg (second most common) fills empty space; each region contains a small colored tile repeated periodically with a few corrupted pixels.

Rule:
- For each region, find the bounding box of non-bg content.
- Infer the smallest repeating tile that explains the pattern (majority vote per residue position), requiring it repeat at least 2x per axis.
- Replace the region with the clean tiled version.

Key insight: Tile dimensions are unknown and must be inferred; prefer the smallest tile with genuine repetition over one that memorizes the entire region.

Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

Paint the teal outline of the right triangle determined by the missing corner of the grey-marker square.

Input structure
The grid is an orange background with exactly four foreground marker pixels of one color. The markers have a square bounding box: three markers are bbox corners, and the fourth marker is inside that square.
Rule
Find the one corner of the marker bounding square that has no marker. That missing corner is the right-angle vertex of a right isosceles triangle; paint its two axis-aligned legs and the opposite diagonal in teal, leaving existing marker pixels unchanged.
Key insight
The present corner marker opposite the missing corner is a decoy; the three triangle vertices are the missing corner and the two marker corners adjacent to it.

Rebuild the foreground rectangles as a largest-to-smallest lower-left nesting.

Input structure
- A periodic wallpaper background is overlaid by foreground colors that each form a rectangular frame or solid rectangle.
- The largest foreground rectangle is the output frame; smaller foreground rectangles are the objects to nest inside it.
- A frame may be partially hidden by a smaller rectangle, but its visible pixels still determine its bbox.

Rule
- Ignore the wallpaper and crop the result to the largest foreground rectangle's bbox size.
- Sort foreground rectangles by bbox area from largest to smallest.
- Reconstruct each frame or solid rectangle, placing every next smaller rectangle in the lower-left of the current rectangle's usable region.

Key insight
- The scattered background colors are not objects; the meaningful order is the unique descending rectangle size chain, and each step nests into the previous rectangle's lower-left interior.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

Recolor each framed interior mask with the color from the next red frame clockwise around the blue connector cycle.

Input structure
- The grid contains hollow red square frames connected pairwise by blue line components.
- The blue components connect the frames into one cycle, with every frame touching exactly two blue components.
- Each frame interior contains background plus exactly one non-background color mask.

Rule
- Sort the red frames clockwise by their centers around the cycle.
- Keep each frame's interior mask shape in place, but recolor it with the interior color from the next clockwise frame.
- Leave the red frames, blue connectors, background, and interior background holes unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored masks do not move; the blue cycle gives the order in which their colors rotate.

Pack all pixels into color-frequency runs along bottom-up columns.

Input structure
The input is a rectangular grid whose colors are all foreground material;
only the number of pixels of each color matters. In the observed task
instances, every present color has a distinct pixel count.

Rule
Count the pixels of each color and order the colors from most frequent to
least frequent. Rewrite a same-size grid by placing each color's full count
as one contiguous run while scanning columns from left to right and, within
each column, from bottom to top.

Key insight
The output preserves the multiset of colors but discards all original
positions, turning the grid into a frequency-sorted column packing.

Slide a solid square through a winding channel to reach a same-sized target square.

Input structure:
- bg (most common color). A river color forms a winding corridor.
- Two same-sized NxN solid squares on the river: mover and destination, each a distinct color.

Rule:
- The mover square travels along the river toward the destination.
- It can only pass through positions where the full NxN area is river.
- If reachable, the mover replaces the destination; otherwise it stops at the farthest reachable point.
- The mover's original position is filled with the river color.

Key insight: Chokepoints narrower than N pixels block the square, forcing it to stop short.

Extend the edge-touching green start bar through the corridor, turning at each teal blocker until the path leaves the grid.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: a 2-pixel 4-connected start bar and many blocker pixels.
- Exactly one pixel of the start bar lies on the grid border.

Rule:
- Start from the border pixel of the bar and move through the other bar pixel into the grid.
- Paint every traversed non-blocker pixel with the start color.
- When the next cell is a blocker, turn to the unique perpendicular non-blocker neighbor; when the next cell is outside the grid, stop.

Key insight: The blocker pixels define a one-cell-wide corridor, so every interior collision has exactly one valid 90-degree turn.

Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Repeat the single colored border segment around the rectangular border, leaving one segment-length gap between copies.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is exactly one foreground color.
- All foreground pixels form one contiguous segment on the rectangular border, possibly crossing the cycle start.

Rule:
- Unwrap the grid border clockwise into a cyclic path.
- Let n be the length of the foreground segment.
- Copy the segment with the same color every 2*n border positions around the cycle.

Key insight:
- The foreground segment is not extended by rows or columns directly; it is a motif on the perimeter cycle, repeated with an equal-sized gap.

Replace each colored corner marker with its corner-specific inward stencil in the same color.

Input structure
- The grid is 8x8 with a single dominant background color.
- Foreground pixels are marker pixels, each located at one of the four corners.
- A marker's color is carried to the stencil selected by its corner position.

Rule
- Erase each corner marker back to the background.
- Top corner markers become an inward 2x2 block one cell away from the top and side edges.
- Bottom corner markers become the mirrored three-pixel inward bent stencil shown by the bottom-corner examples.

Key insight
- The marker position selects the fixed stencil; the marker color only supplies the paint color, so multiple corners apply independently.

Expand each colored control pixel into its corresponding fixed 4x4 glyph.

Input structure:
- Black background with single-pixel markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and/or 8.
- Some inputs also show a sample 4x4 glyph in the output color, with a same-rule marker just below-right of the sample.

Rule:
- Replace each marker color by its learned 4x4 glyph: 2->yellow frame, 3->blue ring, 5->pink diagonal blocks, 8->orange X.
- Paint each glyph with its top-left corner at the marker pixel, clipping at the grid boundary.
- Remove the sample glyphs and skip their below-right label markers.

Key insight:
- The colored pixels are control pixels for a fixed glyph alphabet; non-control sample glyphs are only legend entries, not preserved scene objects.

Complete each boundary tab or notch by adding the complementary feature on the opposite side of the foreground object.

Input structure
- The grid has exactly two colors: a dominant background and one foreground object.
- The foreground object is a thick rectilinear shape with one-pixel tabs and notches on its boundary.

Rule
- A foreground tab is a one-neighbor boundary pixel; project through its full row or column span and remove the opposite edge pixel to make a matching notch.
- A background notch is a one-pixel cut with three foreground 4-neighbors; project across the full row or column span and add a tab just outside the opposite edge.
- Notches immediately beside a tab source are not independent sources, because that gap belongs to the tab's local boundary shape.

Key insight
- The changed pixels are not color-specific noise; they are paired jigsaw-like boundary features on opposite sides of the same thick row or column cross-section.

Flatten the interior object into a centered line and move the guide bars inward to bracket it.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- One non-background guide color touches the boundary and forms exactly two full parallel bars plus a split perpendicular center bar.
- The other non-background color is a single 8-connected interior object whose area determines the flattened line length.

Rule:
- If the guide pair is vertical, make a vertical object-colored line centered between those bars; otherwise use the analogous horizontal line.
- The line length equals the number of interior object pixels and is centered on the split perpendicular guide bar.
- Rebuild the guide color as the perpendicular center bar plus two full bars immediately beside the flattened object line.

Key insight:
- The guide bars supply only the orientation and center; the interior object's pixel count supplies the length of the final one-cell-thick line.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
