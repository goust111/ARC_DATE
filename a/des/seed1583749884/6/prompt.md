Keep only the lower-panel colors named by the top markers and expand each marker into an object-count bar.

Input structure
A black instruction strip sits above a non-black rectangular scene panel.  The strip contains one-cell markers
in the first column, and each marker color is a candidate object color in the lower panel.  The lower panel has
a unique dominant background color and scattered 4-connected foreground objects.

Rule
In the lower panel, preserve objects whose colors appear as top markers and recolor every other foreground
object to the panel background.  In the instruction strip, replace each marker by a horizontal run from column 0
whose length is the number of 4-connected lower-panel objects of that marker color; erase markers with count 0.

Key insight
The top strip is a color filter plus a compact count summary: marker colors select which lower-panel objects
survive, and their bars report the number of surviving objects by color.

Fill enclosed regions along a line seeded by unique border pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Colored lines/drawings on the grid.
- Unique single-pixel colors on the grid border mark seed endpoints of each line.

Rule:
- Each border seed pixel connects (8-connected) to a line drawing.
- Find closed bg cavities whose boundary touches that line.
- Flood-fill each such cavity with the seed pixel's color.

Key insight: Only cavities reachable through the seed's own line get filled; the seed's unique color acts as a per-line fill label.

<description>
Complete sparse nested rectangular color layers into solid rectangles.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and every foreground color marks one
axis-aligned rectangular layer; the layer bboxes have unique areas and are
nested from outermost to innermost.
Rule
Take each color's bbox as its completed rectangle, except that a child bbox
which already matches at least three sides of its parent's one-pixel inset
expands to that full inset; repaint the rectangles largest to smallest.
Key insight
The scattered pixels are samples of nested rectangular regions, so the
output is a clean redraw of those regions with inner colors overwriting
outer colors.

Drop the columns of the top marker downward, stopping blue-ended columns on grey obstacles and letting maroon-ended columns pass to the bottom.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The most numerous non-background color forms stationary grey obstacle pixels.
- The other two colors form a single 3x3 top-edge marker whose top two rows
  are maroon and whose bottom row contains maroon or blue control pixels.

Rule
- Erase the top marker.
- Treat each marker column as a vertical drop retaining its three colors.
- A column whose bottom control pixel is blue stops immediately above the
  first grey pixel below that column, or bottom-aligns if none exists.
- Contiguous maroon-ended columns pass through obstacles and bottom-align;
  if such a run has a clear down-right slide from a grey ledge, shift the
  run one column right before bottom-aligning.
- When a maroon-ended drop lands through a grey bar on the bottom edge, clear
  the rest of the marker-width gap in that bottom bar.

Key insight
- The bottom row of the top marker is a control strip: blue cells mean
  "stick to the first obstacle," while maroon cells mean "fall through."

<description>
Keep the largest 8-connected motif and replace the corner/control pixels with a solid corner triangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Exactly one grid corner contains a foreground control pixel; it gives the
  corner from which the triangle is painted.
- There is one unique largest 8-connected monochrome foreground object, the
  motif that remains in the output; all other foreground pixels are controls.
- Every foreground component outside that motif is a singleton control pixel.
- The fill color is the unique control color that appears in at least two
  non-corner control pixels.

Rule
- Start from a blank background canvas and redraw only the largest motif.
- Count the non-corner control pixels; that count is the triangle side.
- Paint the fill color on the right-triangle region where those two distances
  from the marked corner's edges sum to less than the side length.

Key insight
- The scattered singleton controls are counted into a compact triangular
  stack at the marked corner; only the largest motif is not part of the count.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Mark every complete square object with red pixels just outside its corners.

Input structure:
- A uniform background contains one or more monochrome 4-connected foreground objects.
- The relevant objects are square frames or filled squares: their bbox is square
  and all cells on the bbox border have the object's color.
- Non-square bars and incomplete fragments may also appear and are ignored.

Rule:
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For each complete square object, paint red on the two outside background
  pixels orthogonally adjacent to each of the square's four corners.

Key insight: The transformation is not based on size or color; it selects
objects whose bounding box is a complete square border and labels only their
exposed outer corner-adjacent cells.

Erase the first border pixel hit by extending the red marker away from its pink trail.

Input structure
- The dominant background surrounds a unique red marker and a four-pixel
  pink trail.
- The pink pixels form one straight 8-connected ray starting next to the
  red marker.
- In the opposite direction from that trail, the red marker faces a
  non-background border or obstacle pixel beyond background cells.

Rule
- Keep the whole grid fixed except for the first non-background pixel on
  the ray from the red marker away from the pink trail.
- Recolor that one hit pixel to the background color.

Key insight
- The pink trail marks where the red marker came from, so the edit is found
  by ray-casting from the red marker in the opposite direction.

Cycle each solid odd-sided square to the next smaller centered square, wrapping a single pixel to a 9x9 square.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a separated 4-connected monochrome solid square.
- Square side lengths are odd and belong to the cycle 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- Keep each square's color and center.
- Replace side length n by n - 2 when n > 1; replace side length 1 by side length 9.

Key insight:
- The visible operation is on square size, not color: side lengths cycle 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.

Assemble the foreground objects by docking equal-colored boundary markers edge-to-edge.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and several 4-connected multicolor foreground
objects.  One foreground color is the body color; the less frequent foreground colors are
boundary connector markers, and each marker color appears once as a free end or twice as a
matched docking pair.

Rule
Crop each foreground object to its bounding box and translate the objects so that the two
occurrences of every paired connector color touch on their exposed boundary sides.  Preserve
each object's orientation and colors, then return the tight crop around the assembled
foreground on the original background color.

Key insight
The colored marker pixels are ports: matching colors specify which objects must touch, and
the marker's side of its object determines the direction of the translation.

Move each mirrored bottom source pixel to the far end of its trail and redraw the top half as its reflection.

Input structure
- A solid non-background row separates equal-height top and bottom halves.
- The top half has one marker color on the background.
- In the bottom half, exactly one color has positions that mirror the top markers across the separator, and the other color forms trails touching those source pixels.

Rule
- Identify the bottom source color by reflecting each bottom color into the top half and matching the top marker set.
- For every bottom source pixel, follow its unique 4-connected trail of the other bottom color to the trail endpoint.
- Clear the old top markers, bottom sources, and trails; place the source color at each endpoint and place the top marker color at the reflected endpoint.

Key insight
- The top half is only a mirror display of the bottom moving sources; the actual motion is encoded by the trail attached to each bottom source pixel.

Convert scattered foreground objects into bottom-aligned count bars in a fixed five-color order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and foreground objects in the task
palette: grey, red, teal, maroon, and pink. Objects are monochromatic
8-connected components; some palette colors may be absent.

Rule
For each palette color in order grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, count its
8-connected objects. Create a background grid with five columns and height
equal to the largest count, then fill each column upward from the bottom
with its palette color for that count.

Key insight
The output does not preserve object shapes or positions; it is a histogram
of per-color 8-connected object counts, using the learned palette order.

Within each horizontal pair of two-color panels, swap the motif masks and recolor each pasted mask with the source panel's base color.

Input structure:
- A separator color forms full blank rows and at least one full blank column.
- The non-separator area is split into row bands, each containing exactly two same-shaped rectangular panels.
- Each panel has a dominant base color and one minority motif color.

Rule:
- For every row band, clear each panel to its own base color.
- Paste the right panel's motif mask into the left panel using the right base color.
- Paste the left panel's motif mask into the right panel using the left base color.

Key insight:
- The motif colors themselves are distractors; only each motif's shape mask and the two panel base colors are exchanged.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

Replicate a pre-drawn corner pattern to every other marker-bearing corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most frequent color. Hollow 0-frames (possibly partial L-shapes); each
  frame-corner cell is either 0 or a painted (non-bg, non-0) color.
- >= 1 'source' corner: the pattern is already drawn (one color, both outward
  cells and an inward-diagonal trail).
- Other corners: a single colored pixel on the inward diagonal at the pattern's
  deepest (k,k) offset; the pixel's color is that corner's target color.

Rule:
- Extract the canonical (TL-oriented) pattern from any source.
- For each non-source corner whose marker cell is colored, paint the same
  pattern rotated to that corner's orientation, using the marker's color.

Key insight: the pattern is symmetric about the corner's inward-diagonal axis
(canonical dr == dc), so it reflects cleanly across all four corner orientations.
Painting uses each target's OWN marker color, not the source color.

Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

Extend the edge-touching green start bar through the corridor, turning at each teal blocker until the path leaves the grid.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: a 2-pixel 4-connected start bar and many blocker pixels.
- Exactly one pixel of the start bar lies on the grid border.

Rule:
- Start from the border pixel of the bar and move through the other bar pixel into the grid.
- Paint every traversed non-blocker pixel with the start color.
- When the next cell is a blocker, turn to the unique perpendicular non-blocker neighbor; when the next cell is outside the grid, stop.

Key insight: The blocker pixels define a one-cell-wide corridor, so every interior collision has exactly one valid 90-degree turn.

Compress the L-shaped cue to three rows and add a pink copy of the top-row foreground mask.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a two-color top row, and all
foreground pixels below the top row lie in the first column as vertical markers.

Rule
Keep the input top row as output row 0 and the first marker row as output row 1.
Output row 2 is background except at the top-row foreground columns, which are
recolored pink.

Key insight
The lower repeated marker rows only identify the vertical cue; the generated
row is a recolored mask of the horizontal cue in the top row.

Complete a visible crop into the shared 20x20 binary motif in its matching orientation.

Input structure:
- The grid is a two-color rectangular crop of one rotation/reflection of the same 20x20 motif.
- One color is the motif foreground and the other color is the motif background.

Rule:
- Try each input color as the foreground mask.
- Match that mask against every possible window in every dihedral orientation of the motif.
- Repaint the uniquely matched full 20x20 motif with the matched foreground/background colors.

Key insight:
- The examples are partial windows of one canonical binary pattern; the local crop is distinctive enough to identify the full orientation and offset.

Rotate each blue-started chain of bottom-aligned vertical bars into horizontal bars resting on the same baseline.
Input structure
- The grid has a background and bottom-aligned, one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Blue bars are markers; red bars are body bars that may be chained after a marker.
Rule
- Starting at each blue bar, repeatedly include the next red bar whose column is exactly the current bar's column plus the current bar's height.
- Clear every included vertical bar, then redraw each included bar horizontally to the right from its original bottom cell, with length equal to its vertical height.
- Red bars that are not reached from a blue marker remain unchanged.
Key insight
- A vertical bar's height is also the width it occupies after rotation, so the chain follows immediate horizontal contact after each rotated bar.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
