Pack each solid foreground rectangle twice: wide across the top and tall from the bottom.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and one foreground color; the foreground forms
separate solid rectangles, ordered from left to right.

Rule
Build a 10-row background canvas whose width is the packed width of the wide
versions of the rectangles. For each source rectangle, paint a top-aligned
rectangle of shape min(h,w) by max(h,w), with one background column between
consecutive rectangles. Then, starting again from the left edge, paint a
bottom-aligned rectangle of shape max(h,w) by min(h,w) for each source rectangle,
again separated by one background column.

Key insight
The input rectangles are not copied in their original orientations; each object
contributes one horizontal-facing and one vertical-facing normalized rectangle,
preserving left-to-right object order.

Move colored sprites from the left strip into a framed area at marker-defined targets.

Input structure:
- bg background; rectangular frame on right with colored markers on its edges; sprites in a narrow left strip separated by a constant-color divider column.

Rule:
- For each color, target rows/cols are where both opposite frame edges share that color. Targets are the Cartesian product.
- Erase each sprite from the left and stamp it centered at every target. Higher sprites cover lower ones.

Key insight: One sprite replicates to a grid of row × column marker intersections.

Recolor each side-marked multicolor object embedded in a monochrome panel to its marker color.

Input structure:
- Same-color 4-connected components form monochrome panel regions.
- The bounding box of a panel may contain 4-connected non-panel-color objects.
- A target object touches exactly one side of its panel bbox, and all of its
  pixels on that side have one marker color.

Rule:
- For every target object, fill any panel-colored holes enclosed by the object.
- Recolor the object and filled holes to the side marker color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- A multicolor object's single contact side identifies both which object should
  be normalized and which color should replace it.

Recolor the separated outer regions by rotating their colors one step clockwise around the yellow-orange divider.

Input structure:
- The grid contains a fixed yellow/orange divider structure.
- All other colors form separated 4-connected monochrome regions around that divider.

Rule:
- Leave the yellow and orange pixels unchanged.
- Sort the non-divider regions by their centroid angle around the divider centroid in screen-coordinate clockwise order.
- Each region keeps its cells and receives the color of the previous region in that cyclic order.

Key insight:
- The objects do not move; only the color labels cycle through the spatial order of the regions around the divider.

Move the lower sprite and its pink guide into the upper panel, aligning the sprite to the guide's lower-left branch.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one full-width separator row.
- Below the separator are exactly two foreground roles: a five-pixel guide marker and one monochrome sprite.
- The guide marker has normalized shape {(0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1)} and starts immediately below the separator.

Rule
- Clear the canvas to the background, preserving the separator row.
- Translate the guide marker upward so its top row becomes row 0.
- Move the sprite, preserving its color and shape, so the sprite bbox bottom-right aligns to the translated guide's lower-left branch.

Key insight
- The marker supplies the destination anchor: its lower-left branch cell is where the moved sprite's bbox bottom-right must land.

Recover the repeating background pattern hidden under the largest solid rectangle.

Input structure:
- The grid is covered by a small row/column periodic pattern.
- Several non-pattern colors form solid rectangular foreground objects that
  overwrite the pattern.
- The requested output region is the largest of those solid rectangles.

Rule:
- Find every 4-connected monochromatic object whose bounding box is a filled
  rectangle with both dimensions greater than one.
- Treat those rectangles as masks, infer the smallest repeating tile that is
  consistent with all remaining visible pixels, and repaint the largest
  rectangle's coordinates with that tile.

Key insight: The rectangle colors are occluders; the visible pixels outside
them are enough to reconstruct the original periodic background underneath.

<description>
Transform each 9x9 panel by mirroring across its center guide line or filling all four block slots from its lone exemplar.

Input structure
The grid is made of 9x9 panels separated by one-cell-wide grid lines. Each
panel has four monochrome 3x3 slots at the quadrant positions, with either a
full non-background center row, a full non-background center column, or no
guide line.

Rule
A panel with a full center column is reflected left-to-right, and a panel
with a full center row is reflected top-to-bottom. A panel with no guide line
has exactly one slot color that appears once and one slot color that appears
three times; recolor all four slots to the once-occurring slot color.

Key insight
The center guide line encodes the mirror axis, while panels without a guide
line are completed by copying the structurally unique slot color.

Extract the hidden two-color image by compacting the rows and columns of its complete mask.

Input structure
The grid contains one pair of colors whose pixels occupy every cell in the
cross product of their active rows and active columns; all other colors form
the surrounding filler or separators.
Rule
Find that unique color pair, keep exactly the rows and columns touched by
the pair, and return the induced subgrid.
Key insight
The target image is not chosen by color id; it is the only two-color mask
whose occupied pixels form a full rectangular row/column product after
deleting unused rows and columns.

Crop the largest object and overlay each smaller sprite where its shared marker pattern matches.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color, and the foreground has one largest destination object plus smaller source sprites.
- Each source sprite shares exactly one marker color with the destination object.

Rule
- Output the tight bbox crop of the largest object.
- Translate each source sprite so every connected marker component of the shared color exactly matches destination marker components.
- Paste source sprites in decreasing area order, so smaller sprites can sit on top of larger ones when they overlap.

Key insight
- The shared-color marker components are alignment keys; matching whole marker components distinguishes singleton slots from larger same-color marker blocks.

Extend each solid foreground rectangle toward its same-color isolated pixels with capped one-cell paths, clearing each original marker pixel.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground color has exactly one solid rectangular object and one or more isolated same-color marker pixels.
- Every marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the rectangle bbox and lies outside it.
Rule
- For each marker, draw a one-cell-wide straight path from the adjacent side of the rectangle through one cell beyond the marker.
- Add a three-pixel perpendicular cap at the rectangle end and around the marker endpoint.
- Recolor the original marker pixel to background.
Key insight
- The isolated pixels are not copied; they mark the hollow endpoints of capped protrusions grown from their matching rectangle.

Move each isolated colored pixel into the one-cell frame around a grey 2x2 block.

Input structure:
- Background is the dominant color.
- Grey foreground objects are solid 2x2 anchor blocks.
- Every other non-background, non-grey cell is a colored singleton source.

Rule:
- Keep the grey anchors fixed and clear all colored singleton source pixels.
- For each singleton and each anchor, the normal destination is the cell reached by
  clamping the pixel into the anchor's one-cell outer frame.
- If a diagonally outside singleton has an exact 8-direction sightline into an anchor,
  also allow the cell just before the first grey pixel on that ray.
- Choose distinct destinations that minimize total king-move distance; at equal
  distance prefer exact sightlines, then the shorter Manhattan movement.

Key insight: The grey 2x2 blocks define magnetic frames; conflicts are resolved
structurally by nearest-frame assignment rather than by color identity.

Use local source-target-pattern examples to replace matching source pixels.

Input structure:
- Black background with isolated colored pixels and teal (8) pattern components.
- A rule example is a 4-neighbor colored pair source->target whose continued
  direction reaches an anchor touching a teal pattern component.

Rule:
- For each rule example, copy that teal component onto every other pixel of
  source.color, recoloring the copied component to target.color.
- Translation maps the rule anchor onto the source pixel being replaced.
- Remove teal components and all pixels used by rule examples.

Key insight: The two adjacent colored pixels define the color substitution and
the anchor point; the nearby teal component is the stencil that gets recolored.

Dock movable tools into border-anchored frames by filling cavities.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Border-touching components cluster into anchor frames with interior bg cavities.
- Non-border 2-color components are movable tools.

Rule:
- Match each tool to a frame whose cavity size equals one of its color-region counts.
- Rotate/flip the tool so one color fills the cavity exactly; the other stays outside.
- If the docking orientation uses a reflection, swap the tool's two colors.

Key insight: Cavity size determines tool–frame pairing; reflection triggers color swap.

Recolor each framed interior mask with the color from the next red frame clockwise around the blue connector cycle.

Input structure
- The grid contains hollow red square frames connected pairwise by blue line components.
- The blue components connect the frames into one cycle, with every frame touching exactly two blue components.
- Each frame interior contains background plus exactly one non-background color mask.

Rule
- Sort the red frames clockwise by their centers around the cycle.
- Keep each frame's interior mask shape in place, but recolor it with the interior color from the next clockwise frame.
- Leave the red frames, blue connectors, background, and interior background holes unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored masks do not move; the blue cycle gives the order in which their colors rotate.

Assemble scattered jigsaw pieces into a rectangle, recoloring each by a legend sprite's color map.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several monochrome non-bg sprites (the "pieces"), scattered across the grid.
- One sprite is the legend: it contains a multi-color k×k patch (typically 2×2) encoding output colors.

Rule:
- Tile all pieces (rotations/reflections allowed) into a tight rectangle with no gaps.
- The legend's k×k color patch defines a spatial color map over the rectangle.
- Each piece is recolored to the legend-map color corresponding to its position in the assembled rectangle.

Key insight: The legend piece doubles as both a jigsaw piece and a color key — its internal k×k palette assigns colors by spatial quadrant.

Composite two pattern tiles into a fourth panel using flood-fill from an indicator pixel.

Input structure:
- Four 5×5 panels in one row, border-separated.
- Panel 0: cue pixels = wall boundary (8-connected, edge-to-edge, through center)
           + one 8-isolated indicator pixel.
- Panels 1–2: source patterns. Panel 3: blank (to fill).

Rule:
- Flood-fill (4-conn) from indicator, blocked by wall → inside region.
- Inside → non-bg from panel 1; outside → non-bg from panel 2.
- Wall → panel 1 if non-bg; panel 2 fallback when wall is 4-connected.

Key insight: The cue panel's isolated indicator and wall partition the tile into inside/outside masks that select between the two source panels.

Assemble scattered colored fragments into a left-right symmetric rectangle, jigsaw-style.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; remaining colors form small sprite fragments.
- Optional roles: 4 singleton pixels of one color mark corners; horizontal bars mark top/bottom edges; paired vertical lines mark left/right edges.

Rule:
- Collect all non-bg connected components as jigsaw pieces.
- Determine output rectangle dimensions from total piece area.
- Pack pieces into the rectangle so it is exactly mirror-symmetric (left-right) and same-color pieces never 4-touch.

Key insight: Left-right symmetry plus the no-same-color-touching constraint make the assembly unique; corner/edge markers anchor it when present.

Move a triangular sprite across the grid, consuming aligned marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Frames concatenated horizontally with solid divider columns; bg is most common color.
- Each frame: a triangular arrow-shaped sprite and scattered single-pixel markers, all one color.

Rule:
- Start from the rightmost frame.
- At each step, exactly one cardinal direction from the head has reachable
  markers (on a half-line: same row or column); the sprite advances to the
  nearest one.
- On reaching a marker, consume it; sprite re-faces that direction.
- Repeat until no markers remain; output the final sprite position on a clean bg.

Key insight: The triangle's tip encodes facing direction, which sets marker-consumption priority.

Complete the framed area by expanding the unique upper template that contains the existing seed pixels.

Input structure:
- A teal background contains small colored template masks above a larger rectangular frame.
- The frame encloses one fill color arranged as a partial block-scaled copy of one template.
- The frame interior dimensions are an integer square scale of the matching template bbox.

Rule:
- Crop to the rectangular frame.
- Identify the unique upper template whose block-scaled mask covers every existing fill pixel inside the frame.
- Reset the frame interior to background and paint the whole scaled mask with the fill color.

Key insight:
The lower colored pixels are seed cells that reveal which upper template should be completed inside the frame.

Combine the left, middle, and right ordered objects from three separated panels.

Input structure
- The grid is three HxH panels separated by one-cell vertical separator bars.
- The background is the dominant color, and each panel contains exactly three same-color 4-connected foreground objects.

Rule
- Build a new HxH background canvas.
- From the left panel copy its leftmost object, from the middle panel copy its middle object, and from the right panel copy its rightmost object.

Key insight
- The separator bars create three aligned layers, and the panel's own left-to-right object order selects which object survives in the merged output.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
