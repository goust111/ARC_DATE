Move each right-side colored shape into the left slot whose template color is its exact complement.

Input structure:
- The grid has two equal-width slots separated by one background column.
- Non-background rows form horizontal bands separated by all-background rows.
- Each band has a shared template color in the left slot and one colored source shape in the right slot.

Rule:
- For each band, define its destination shape as the cells in the left slot not occupied by the template color.
- Normalize every right-side source shape to right-slot coordinates and match it to the unique equal destination shape.
- Clear the original right-side source pixels and paint the matched left-slot complement with the source color.

Key insight:
The right-side objects are not placed by row order; each one completes the unique left template whose missing cells have the same shape.

Crop off the control row and column, then cyclically roll the payload by the two marker offsets.

Input structure
- The grid is square, with a control row on top and a control column on the left.
- The control row and column share one filler color and one single-pixel marker color.
- The lower-right square is the payload and contains none of the control colors.

Rule
- Remove the top control row and left control column.
- Roll the remaining payload down by the marker's zero-based position in the left control column.
- Roll the payload right by the marker's zero-based position in the top control row.

Key insight
- The two border markers are cyclic shift amounts for the payload, not colors to preserve.

Replace the active black cutout's tail with background and mark the cutout side facing a colored source region.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background, with black rectangle-plus-tail cutouts, one gray source region, and colored distractors.
- Non-gray colored regions and single pixels are distractors/blockers, even when they are multi-pixel staircase shapes.

Rule:
- Find each black cutout whose largest solid rectangle leaves exactly a two-pixel tail.
- The active gray source region is visible only by horizontal rays through background from a cutout's left or right side.
- Select the unique cutout side with the most same-source visible rows, erase that cutout's tail to background, and recolor the full selected vertical side pink (6).

Key insight:
- The colored regions do not move; their horizontal line-of-sight identifies which rectangular cutout is being opened and which side receives the pink mark.

Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

Build a red ray network by activating blue blobs via directional green ports.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Large blue blobs with adjacent green pixels marking port directions.
- Start marker: yellow pixel atop a short red segment at grid bottom.

Rule:
- Extend a ray upward from start; on hitting a blue blob, recolor it red.
- Activated blobs emit thick rays through green ports until boundary or another blob.
- Cascade until no new blobs are reached.

Key insight: Green pixels encode ray direction and width; the network activates as a chain reaction from one start point.

Normalize vertical two-color bars between paired marker columns around the marker rows.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- A row of red marker pixels sits directly above a row of gray marker pixels
  in the same alternating columns.
- The columns between adjacent markers contain vertical bars made from a
  contiguous teal run above a contiguous blue run.

Rule
- Keep the marker pixels and all non-bar background cells fixed.
- Let h be the maximum teal-run height among the bar columns; paint teal in
  every bar column for h rows ending at the red marker row.
- In each bar column, move its blue run to start at the gray marker row and
  fill all lower cells in that column with maroon.

Key insight
- The marker rows are a baseline: teal is normalized into a common upper
  band, while each blue run keeps its own height below the baseline.

Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Scale a minority cell's inner pattern up to the cell-grid level, completing a fractal overlay.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into NxN cells by separator lines of a single color.
- Most cells share an identical interior pattern (majority); a few have a distinct pattern (minority).

Rule:
- Extract the inner pixel pattern from the minority cell.
- Treat each pixel as a cell-sized stamp: active pixels → minority pattern, inactive → majority pattern.
- Position this scaled-up pattern on the cell grid so existing minority cells align with active pixels.
- Fill in all remaining active positions with the minority pattern.

Key insight: The minority cell's interior is a miniature blueprint of where minority cells should appear at the grid scale — fractal self-similarity.

Recolor the small defect bars on each shared-color object with the opposite panel color.

Input structure
- The grid contains two large panel colors and one shared object color.
- Each shared-color object is a mostly solid rectangle inside exactly one panel.
Rule
- Find the near-solid rectangular core of each object.
- Missing core pixels and one-cell protrusions define two-pixel bars perpendicular to the nearest core edge.
- Recolor those bars with the other panel color; leave all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The colors to add are not tied to numeric ids: each object's surrounding panel identifies the opposite panel color.

Merge same-sized filled rectangular objects by overlaying their internal marker pixels.

Input structure:
- A dominant background surrounds two or more separated 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every object is a filled rectangle of the same size.
- Each rectangle has the same majority base color plus one or more non-base marker pixels.

Rule:
- Create one output rectangle with the shared object size, filled with the shared base color.
- For each input rectangle, copy every non-base marker pixel to the same relative location
  in the output.
- Marker overlays must either land on base color or agree in color with an existing marker.

Key insight:
The separated rectangles are layers of the same template; their colored marker pixels
combine by local coordinates while the repeated base fill is just the output canvas.

Fill holes inside a large template frame using shape-matched outside sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. One large monochrome frame object (template).
- Inside the frame: holes of various shapes (non-frame-color regions).
- Outside the frame: small monochrome sprites scattered on bg.

Rule:
- Crop to the frame's bounding box; fill entirely with frame color.
- For each hole, find an outside sprite whose shape matches (rotation/flip allowed).
- Fill the hole with the matched sprite's color. If multiple sprites match, use the most frequent color.

Key insight: Sprites act as shape-coded color keys — their shape identifies which hole they fill, their color determines the fill color.

Decode the colored 3x3 contour motif into a 16x16 periodic lattice with the motif stamped in maroon at the center.

Input structure:
- The grid is 6x6 with orange background and one non-orange color.
- The non-orange pixels have a tight 3x3 bbox containing one contour glyph.
- The glyph is one of the task's period-3 contour forms: plus, H, X, or four corners.

Rule:
- Decode the 3x3 glyph into the period-3 orange phase tile.
- Fill a black 16x16 canvas by repeating that orange phase tile.
- Tile the original 3x3 glyph 2x2 and recolor its true pixels to maroon in the centered 6x6 region.

Key insight:
- The colored object is not copied at its input location; it is a small contour code whose phase tells where orange appears in the repeated lattice.

Slide each black border rectangle to the opposite border, recoloring its swept stripe orange and leaving the rectangle black at the far edge.

Input structure
- The grid contains black rectangular 4-connected masks, each touching exactly one outer border.
- Grey cells form incidental pattern content; orange is the trail color used when a black mask slides.

Rule
- Treat all black rectangles as moving simultaneously.
- A rectangle touching the top or bottom edge moves vertically to the opposite edge in the same columns.
- A rectangle touching the left or right edge moves horizontally to the opposite edge in the same rows.
- Recolor the complete swept row or column stripe to orange, then stamp every destination rectangle in black.

Key insight
- Edge contact gives the slide direction; the output is the set of opposite-edge black rectangles plus their orange trails.

Transmit colored tokens along wire networks, converting each to its complementary 3×3 pattern.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Non-bg cells form wire networks and 3×3 tokens (solid blocks or X/diagonal patterns) near wire endpoints.

Rule:
- Every solid 3×3 token is replaced in-place by a diamond (center + 4 cardinal neighbors).
- Each token near a wire endpoint sends its complement to the opposite endpoint: solid emits X, X emits diamond.

Key insight: Token shape cycles solid → X → diamond; wires route each complement to the far end.

Stamp source sprites into a destination frame via color-matched singleton markers.

Input structure:
- Two bordered rectangles: source (multi-cell sprites) and destination (singleton markers).
- Each sprite has an anchor pixel — its least-frequent color. Markers share these colors.

Rule:
- Match each destination marker to the source sprite with the same anchor color.
- Translate the sprite so its anchor overlaps the marker position.
- Output is the destination rectangle, interior cleared before stamping.

Key insight: The rarest color per sprite doubles as a template key and positioning anchor.

Move each gray marker along its green path until it reaches the cell next to a black-green-black gate, erasing the path behind it.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground components are made from a path color, a paired gate-end color, and single marker pixels.
- A gate is a straight end-center-end motif whose center has the path color and whose two ends share the gate-end color.

Rule:
- In every 4-connected foreground component with exactly one marker and one gate, erase the marker and all path-color pixels except the gate center.
- Place the marker on the unique path-color pixel adjacent to the gate center but not between the two gate ends.
- Components without both a marker and a gate stay unchanged.

Key insight: The black-green-black motif marks the stopping gate; the gray marker consumes the connected green path until it rests on the path cell immediately beside that gate.

Assemble and place enlarged sprites on a canvas using legend-panel instructions.

Input structure:
- Color-6 separators divide the grid into a left legend column and a main canvas.
- Each legend panel has (top to bottom): a unit sprite, a frame template, a 5x5 bordered square with a position-marker pixel, and a 3x3 rotation clock-hand.

Rule:
- Tile the unit sprite into each active cell of the frame to build an enlarged composite.
- Rotate the composite per the clock-hand direction (up=0, right=90, down=180, left=270 degrees).
- Place it on the canvas anchored at the position encoded by the marker pixel's row/col in the bordered square's 3x3 inner grid.

Key insight: The marker pixel's position in a 3x3 grid jointly encodes vertical and horizontal anchor alignment (start/middle/end).

Move each colored object vertically until it touches the matching top or bottom border bar.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The top row is a full-width bar in one foreground color and the bottom row is a full-width bar in another.
- All other foreground pixels are 8-connected monochrome objects whose color matches one of those bars.

Rule:
- Top-bar-colored objects move upward so their bbox top is row 1.
- Bottom-bar-colored objects move downward so their bbox bottom is the row above the bottom bar.
- A downward-moving one-column segment whose landing overlaps its source becomes the continuous vertical segment swept between them.

Key insight:
The horizontal bars are destination anchors: color determines which border an object slides toward, while columns and object shape are otherwise preserved.

Fill rectangular cavities in a template shape by placing source sprites into matching holes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. A dominant "base" color forms a large frame/template with rectangular gaps.
- Small colored sprites sit outside the template region.

Rule:
- The base color (largest connected component excluding bg) defines the template bbox.
- Each rectangular hole inside the template matches exactly one outside sprite by size.
- Place each sprite into its matching cavity; output is the filled template bbox.

Key insight: Sprite bounding boxes match cavity dimensions exactly — it's a jigsaw-fit puzzle where each piece has a unique slot.

Delete connected components whose colors match a legend swatch.

Input structure:
- Background (bg) fills most of the grid.
- Top-left corner: a small square legend region bordered on its bottom and right edges by a single color; the interior holds a set of "target" colors.
- Elsewhere: multicolored objects (4-connected components) on the bg.

Rule:
- Read the target color set from inside the legend border.
- For each connected component, check whether it contains **all** target colors.
- Erase (fill with bg) every component that does; leave all others unchanged.
- Output grid is the same size.

Key insight: The legend acts as a filter specification — only components carrying the full color palette shown in the legend are removed.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
