Sort vertical bars by height and redistribute them across fixed colored slots.

Input structure:
- bg background; a horizontal base line of a single color spans the full grid width.
- Several monochrome vertical bars of distinct colors rise upward from the base line.

Rule:
- Rank bar shapes by height (shortest to tallest).
- Rank original x-positions (slots) left to right.
- Place the i-th shortest shape into the i-th leftmost slot, recoloring it to that slot's original color.
- The base line is preserved unchanged.

Key insight: Each slot keeps its x-position and color identity; only the bar silhouettes are redistributed among slots by height order.

Connect same-colored foreground components with one-cell-wide orthogonal paths around teal wall segments.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Teal cells are fixed wall segments and are never source connectors.
- Other foreground colors appear as one or more 4-connected components; colors with a single component stay unchanged.

Rule
- For each non-background, non-teal color, read its 4-connected components in row-major order.
- Connect each consecutive pair by the shortest clear L-shaped path between the two components.
- Clear paths may pass only through background or the same color, and they preserve the previous travel axis when both bends are possible.

Key insight
- The output is not a global recolor: each color traces a routed chain through its own components while teal cells and other colors act as blockers.

Copy the unique colored sprite tile into every tiled cell marked by an internal separator-colored pixel.

Input structure
- Full same-color separator rows and columns partition the grid into equal rectangular tiles.
- One tile contains the only non-background, non-separator colored sprite.
- Target tiles are otherwise background-colored but contain at least one internal pixel of the separator color.

Rule
- Keep the separator lines and the source sprite tile unchanged.
- Replace each marked target tile with an exact copy of the source tile.
- Unmarked background-only tiles remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The internal separator-colored pixels are placement markers; the single colored tile is the template to stamp into those marked cells.

Mirror the smallest non-axis foreground color across the full straight axis.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color forms exactly one full row, column, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal reflection axis.
- The remaining foreground colors include a unique least-populated color to copy.

Rule
- Preserve the input grid.
- Select every pixel of the unique smallest non-axis foreground color.
- Reflect those pixels across the full straight axis and paint the reflected positions with the same color.

Key insight
- The axis color marks the mirror line, while the color population chooses which set of objects is duplicated.

Recolor the large mask crop column-by-column using the separate three-row palette strip.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- One large monochrome foreground object is the mask; its bbox is the output region and may contain background holes.
- The remaining foreground is a 3-row palette rectangle with the same width as the mask bbox: two identical color rows and one uniform row.

Rule:
- Crop to the mask object's bbox.
- For each output column, color mask pixels with the corresponding color from the repeated palette rows.
- Replace background holes inside the crop with the palette's uniform third-row color.

Key insight:
The grey object is only a stencil; its columns select colors from the legend, while its holes expose the legend's fill color.

Connect two sprites using matching connector pixels, then tight-crop.

Input structure:
- Background color `bg`, sprite color `obj`, connector color `ctrl` (small, 2 components).
- Two main foreground sprites, plus possibly tiny detached pixels belonging to one sprite.

Rule:
- Identify the **base** sprite (closest to grid top-left).
- Translate the other sprite so its connector sits one cell above the base's connector.
- Stamp the plug onto the base; remove connectors (recolor `ctrl` to `obj`).
- Output is the tight crop around all non-background pixels.

Key insight: The connector pixels define the unique docking point and direction.

Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Add a quantity-color label in the top marker column for each horizontal bar.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background and one non-background marker pixel in the top row.
- Below the marker row, every non-empty source row contains one solid monochrome horizontal bar to the left of the marker column.
- Source rows are staggered every other row.

Rule
- Copy the input grid.
- For each source bar, read its quantity as the bar length.
- Paint the quantity color in the marker column on the same row as the bar:
  2->1, 3->4, 4->9, 5->6.

Key insight
- The grey marker supplies the result column, while each bar supplies a small quantity with a fixed color code.

Extend each of two aligned rectangular marker objects toward the other, filling half of the gap across the full perpendicular span.

Input structure
- A dominant background contains exactly two solid, same-sized monochromatic rectangles.
- The rectangles share either the same row span or the same column span, with a background gap between their facing edges.

Rule
- If the rectangles are side-by-side, color the left half of the inter-object gap across every row with the left object's color, and the right half with the right object's color.
- If one rectangle is above the other, color the upper half of the gap across every column with the upper object's color, and the lower half with the lower object's color.
- When the gap length is odd, leave the center row/column as background.

Key insight
- The marker objects are endpoints of an axial corridor; their own size identifies the facing edge, while the filled corridor spans the whole grid perpendicular to that axis.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Move each isolated colored pixel into the one-cell frame around a grey 2x2 block.

Input structure:
- Background is the dominant color.
- Grey foreground objects are solid 2x2 anchor blocks.
- Every other non-background, non-grey cell is a colored singleton source.

Rule:
- Keep the grey anchors fixed and clear all colored singleton source pixels.
- For each singleton and each anchor, the normal destination is the cell reached by
  clamping the pixel into the anchor's one-cell outer frame.
- If a diagonally outside singleton has an exact 8-direction sightline into an anchor,
  also allow the cell just before the first grey pixel on that ray.
- Choose distinct destinations that minimize total king-move distance; at equal
  distance prefer exact sightlines, then the shorter Manhattan movement.

Key insight: The grey 2x2 blocks define magnetic frames; conflicts are resolved
structurally by nearest-frame assignment rather than by color identity.

Fill hollow sprites' interiors using a color-palette legend on the grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Several hollow sprites with distinct border colors.
- A small 2×N or N×2 palette block sits on one grid edge; one row/column lists border colors, the other lists corresponding fill colors.

Rule:
- Locate the palette legend on a grid edge and read it as a border→fill color mapping.
- Find enclosed bg regions (holes) inside sprites that don't touch the grid boundary.
- For each hole, identify the most common adjacent border color, look it up in the palette, and fill the hole with the mapped fill color.

Key insight: The palette's edge position and orientation determine reading direction; border colors in the palette uniquely key into fill colors.

Move the single marker to the endpoint reached by sliding along the obstacle contour.

Input structure:
- A dominant background color fills the canvas.
- One single-pixel marker sits away from a connected obstacle region of the
  remaining color.
- The marker has exactly one horizontal or vertical sightline to the obstacle.

Rule:
- Find the last background pixel before the obstacle along that sightline.
- From that pixel, try the two diagonal turns that continue around the
  obstacle boundary.
- Move the marker to the endpoint of the turn that remains 4-adjacent to the
  obstacle for the longest distance.

Key insight:
The marker is not placed by distance to the obstacle; it first points to the
obstacle, then follows the visible outside contour until that contour segment ends.

Extract the top-left or top-right 2x2 corner crop selected by the top edge clue.

Input structure
- The input is a square color grid whose answer is one of the two 2x2 crops
  touching the top edge and a grid corner.
- A repeated color on the top row, when present, acts as the primary side cue.
- Otherwise, the two top corner colors have different whole-grid frequencies.

Rule
- If a top-row color repeats, find the repeated top-row occurrence nearest to
  a left or right edge and take the 2x2 top-corner crop on that side.
- If the top row has no repeated color, compare the whole-grid frequencies of
  the two top-corner colors and take the side whose corner color is rarer.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for an arbitrary 2x2 search: the decisive information
  is on the top edge, and it selects which top corner crop to keep.

Recolor the shortest path between two terminal squares in a square-and-track graph.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two non-bg colors form solid NxN squares (N>=2): one color marks exactly 2 terminals, the other marks stations.
- A third non-bg color forms 1-cell-wide track segments connecting pairs of squares (graph edges).

Rule:
- Find the shortest path (fewest edges) between the two terminal squares.
- Recolor every station square on that path to green.
- Recolor every track segment along that path to grey.
- Everything else unchanged.

Key insight: The grid encodes a graph where squares are nodes and tracks are edges; the task is graph shortest-path, not spatial proximity.

Move a triangular sprite across the grid, consuming aligned marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Frames concatenated horizontally with solid divider columns; bg is most common color.
- Each frame: a triangular arrow-shaped sprite and scattered single-pixel markers, all one color.

Rule:
- Start from the rightmost frame.
- At each step, exactly one cardinal direction from the head has reachable
  markers (on a half-line: same row or column); the sprite advances to the
  nearest one.
- On reaching a marker, consume it; sprite re-faces that direction.
- Repeat until no markers remain; output the final sprite position on a clean bg.

Key insight: The triangle's tip encodes facing direction, which sets marker-consumption priority.

Cast yellow horizontal and vertical rays from the teal rectangle until blue blockers stop them.

Input structure:
- A black-background grid containing one solid teal rectangle.
- Blue objects are blockers; other non-background objects may lie in the ray paths.
- Yellow is absent from the input and is the output paint color.

Rule:
- From every row of the teal rectangle, cast rays left and right to the grid edge.
- From every column of the teal rectangle, cast rays up and down to the grid edge.
- A ray stops before a blue pixel; all crossed non-blue, non-teal pixels become yellow.

Key insight:
The teal rectangle defines a full cross-shaped projection, while blue objects are walls and red/background cells are simply paintable space.

Draw the marker-colored route through the centers of all doors in the parallel wall maze.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background, parallel full-span walls, one three-pixel door
  segment in each wall, and two marker pixels sharing a color.
- Walls are either all vertical or all horizontal, and the markers are on
  opposite outer sides of the wall set.

Rule:
- Keep the scene unchanged except for the route.
- Visit the door centers in wall order from the upper/left marker side to
  the lower/right marker side.
- In each corridor, draw an orthogonal path to the cell just before the next
  wall, move along that wall to the door center, cross the center, and
  continue to the next corridor; after the last door, connect to the other
  marker.

Key insight:
- The three-pixel door segments mark the only crossing points through a set
  of parallel walls, so the output is the corridor path threaded through
  those centers.

Remove diagonal staircase noise and complete broken straight lines.

Input structure:
- bg = background; one foreground color fg forming axis-aligned lines.
- Some fg pixels form 45° diagonal chains (8-connected but 4-disconnected from lines).

Rule:
- Delete all diagonal-only fg pixels (those with no orthogonal fg neighbor, only diagonal ones).
- Fill short gaps in horizontal/vertical lines where a deleted diagonal was nearby.
- Prune remaining diagonal-adjacent leaf pixels near former diagonal sites.

Key insight: Diagonal pixels are hints marking where a straight line is broken; their span sets the maximum gap size to fill.

Emit four teal beams from a square, turning at colored obstacles per a legend.

Input structure:
- Top band: grey (5) legend with colored vertical bars in cells; bar position (left or right) encodes turn direction.
- Below: main grid with bg, a solid teal (8) square, and colored obstacle blocks.

Rule:
- Remove the legend from the output.
- From the teal square, shoot a beam in each cardinal direction (as a sliding copy of the square).
- Each beam paints teal over bg cells as it moves.
- On hitting an obstacle of color C, consult the legend: bar on left → turn counterclockwise, bar on right → turn clockwise. Continue in the new direction.
- Beams stop at grid edges.

Key insight: The legend's bar position (left vs right within its cell) is the encoding for turn direction at each obstacle color.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
