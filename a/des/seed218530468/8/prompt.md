Draw a polyline by decoding 3x3 glyph instructions read across a divided grid.

Input structure:
- Left of a full-height vertical divider: 3x3 colored glyphs on bg.
- Right of divider: a single gray (5) start pixel.

Rule:
- Remove the divider; shift the gray start into the left canvas.
- Read glyphs in column-major order (left→right, top→bottom).
- Each glyph's shape (pixel area) encodes a segment: area 4 → down 2, area 5 → right 3, area 6 → left 4, area 7 → left 2.
- Append segments sequentially, stepping down one cell between each.

Key insight: Glyph pixel count (area) uniquely determines both segment length and direction — the shape itself is the instruction.

Remove diagonal staircase noise and complete broken straight lines.

Input structure:
- bg = background; one foreground color fg forming axis-aligned lines.
- Some fg pixels form 45° diagonal chains (8-connected but 4-disconnected from lines).

Rule:
- Delete all diagonal-only fg pixels (those with no orthogonal fg neighbor, only diagonal ones).
- Fill short gaps in horizontal/vertical lines where a deleted diagonal was nearby.
- Prune remaining diagonal-adjacent leaf pixels near former diagonal sites.

Key insight: Diagonal pixels are hints marking where a straight line is broken; their span sets the maximum gap size to fill.

Complete each partially hidden simple foreground shape by recoloring the occluding pixels in its footprint.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several solid foreground shapes.
- Some shapes are partially hidden by other foreground colors, but their full
  footprint is still indicated by a foreground-filled bbox or by a foreground-
  filled 45-degree diagonal line.

Rule
- For each foreground color, complete its full rectangular bbox when that bbox
  contains no background and includes other colors.
- Otherwise, complete its 45-degree diagonal line when all visible pixels lie
  on that line and the hidden line cells are foreground, not background.
- Recolor only those hidden footprint pixels; leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The occluded cells are exactly the non-background cells inside a simple
  shape's implied footprint, so completing shapes is a local recoloring problem.

Extract the lattice subregion bounded by the four background-colored corner holes.

Input structure:
- A regular one-cell-thick lattice has one line color, one background color,
  and sparse marker pixels.
- Exactly four lattice-line intersections are background-colored holes instead
  of line-color pixels.

Rule:
- Find the unique non-background color that forms regular horizontal and
  vertical lattice lines.
- Use the four background-colored lattice intersections as the corners of one
  rectangle.
- Return the inclusive crop between those corner rows and columns.

Key insight:
- The crop is marked by the missing lattice intersections, not by the marker
  pixels inside the cells.

Align parallel colored line segments so they all share the same start and end positions as a reference line.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several parallel line segments (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical), each a different color, running in the same direction but starting/ending at different positions.

Rule:
- Detect the dominant direction shared by all segments.
- Pick the median segment (by perpendicular offset) as the reference.
- Shift every segment along the shared direction so its start aligns with the reference's start, then trim or extend it to match the reference's length.
- Grid size stays the same; isolated single pixels are untouched.

Key insight: The reference is the median line, not the longest; all segments are snapped to its extent regardless of their original length.

Fill rectangular cavities in a template shape by placing source sprites into matching holes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. A dominant "base" color forms a large frame/template with rectangular gaps.
- Small colored sprites sit outside the template region.

Rule:
- The base color (largest connected component excluding bg) defines the template bbox.
- Each rectangular hole inside the template matches exactly one outside sprite by size.
- Place each sprite into its matching cavity; output is the filled template bbox.

Key insight: Sprite bounding boxes match cavity dimensions exactly — it's a jigsaw-fit puzzle where each piece has a unique slot.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Move the repeated boundary color's rectangles one block inward while leaving singleton boundary rectangles in place.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Foreground objects are solid monochrome rectangles touching a grid corner.
- Exactly one foreground color appears as multiple separate 4-connected objects; other colors appear once.

Rule:
- Clear the multiple objects of the repeated color from their original positions.
- For each cleared rectangle, translate it away from the row and column border it touches by exactly its height and width.
- Keep singleton-color objects unchanged; overlapping translated rectangles of the same color merge.

Key insight:
- Multiplicity selects the moving color, and each boundary rectangle's touched edges determine its inward diagonal translation.

Paint straight rays from colored side markers into the hollow diamond frame until an interior foreground pixel blocks each ray.

Input structure
- The background contains one complete one-pixel-thick diamond frame.
- Colored marker pixels outside the diamond sit on the top, bottom, left, or right side of the frame's bounding box.
- Any non-background, non-frame pixels inside the diamond are blockers that remain unchanged.

Rule
- Each outside marker emits inward perpendicular to its side of the diamond bounding box.
- Along that row or column, paint only background pixels strictly inside the diamond with the marker color.
- Stop a ray when it reaches an existing interior foreground pixel; keep the frame and all original colored pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The diamond frame defines a strict interior, while the side markers are column or row emitters whose color fills the visible interior interval until blocked.

Complete outlined shapes and carry attached shadow pixels along their edges.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Each active color marks vertices of an 8-direction aligned outline.
- A start vertex can have adjacent non-bg, different-colored shadow pixels.
- Other colored pixels may be distractors unless they lie on valid drawable edges.

Rule:
- For each color, order its pixels by polar angle around their centroid to form a cycle.
- Draw only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree edges whose interiors are clear.
- From the chosen start vertex, copy adjacent shadow offsets along each drawable edge
  when the parallel path is in bounds and clear.

Key insight: The main outline is reconstructed first, then the start vertex's neighbor offsets define parallel shadow strokes.

Remove each fracture marker line and push the surrounding object pixels one cell away from it.

Input structure
- A background grid with 8-connected foreground objects made from a body color and a rarer marker color.
- Each object has a non-square bbox; the marker pixels form one complete fracture line across the shorter bbox axis.

Rule
- Erase all marker pixels.
- For a wide object, each row has one marker; body pixels left of it shift one cell left and body pixels right of it shift one cell right.
- For a tall object, each column has one marker; body pixels above it shift one cell up and body pixels below it shift one cell down.

Key insight
- The marker line is a crack through the object, so the two sides separate by one pixel perpendicular to the crack.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

Carve color-matched motifs into solid blocks and pack them into a compact grid.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several solid 5×5 monochrome blocks, each a distinct non-bg color.
- For each block color, a small same-colored motif sprite elsewhere on the grid.

Rule:
- Match each motif to its same-colored 5×5 block.
- Center the motif within the block and recolor those cells to bg (punching holes).
- Pack all carved blocks into an output grid preserving their original row/column order, separated by 1-cell gaps and a 1-cell outer border.

Key insight: The motif acts as a stencil — it's not stamped onto the block but carved out of it as background holes.

Assemble and place enlarged sprites on a canvas using legend-panel instructions.

Input structure:
- Color-6 separators divide the grid into a left legend column and a main canvas.
- Each legend panel has (top to bottom): a unit sprite, a frame template, a 5x5 bordered square with a position-marker pixel, and a 3x3 rotation clock-hand.

Rule:
- Tile the unit sprite into each active cell of the frame to build an enlarged composite.
- Rotate the composite per the clock-hand direction (up=0, right=90, down=180, left=270 degrees).
- Place it on the canvas anchored at the position encoded by the marker pixel's row/col in the bordered square's 3x3 inner grid.

Key insight: The marker pixel's position in a 3x3 grid jointly encodes vertical and horizontal anchor alignment (start/middle/end).

Swap a connector segment with repeated marker sprites by connecting the marker anchors and stamping the sprite at the segment endpoints.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors. One foreground color forms a single straight 8-connected segment. The other foreground color forms two or more identical centered sprites.

Rule
Build a background canvas of the same size. Draw straight connector-color segments between every pair of original sprite anchors. Then stamp the marker sprite, using its centered anchor, onto the two endpoints of the original connector segment.

Key insight
The original segment endpoints are the destinations for the repeated sprite, while the original sprite centers become the vertices of the new connector-color complete graph.

Erase the top palette row and redraw it below as a widening wedge centered on its missing cell.

Input structure
- The top row is a palette row with exactly one background gap.
- Below it, the only foreground is one vertical marker bar of a single color.
- The marker bar is either in the gap column or immediately beside it.

Rule
- Clear the grid to background.
- Starting at the top of the marker bar, each next row copies one more
  column of the top-row palette on both sides of the gap.
- Fill the gap column with the marker color, and keep the vertical marker bar.

Key insight
- The lone background cell in the top row is the center of the expanding
  copy; the lower vertical bar provides the center color and the row where
  the expansion begins.

Complete a sparse grid by casting occluding diagonal rays from the longest run and filling the remaining diagonal-connected regions from the short bars.

Input structure
- Black-background grid with one unique longest 4-connected foreground object.
- The longest object is a horizontal or vertical multicolor run; all other foreground objects are shorter monochrome bars.

Rule
- On a blank canvas, process the longest run from left to right or top to bottom; each pixel emits four 45-degree rays that stop at the first already-painted pixel.
- Each remaining monochrome bar fills every still-blank pixel reachable from it by diagonal steps.

Key insight
- Earlier pixels in the long run occlude later diagonal rays, and those ray barriers partition the background into diagonal-connected regions for the short bars.

Slide yellow pixels inside walled regions in the direction dictated by border-legend arrows.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; yellow pixels sit inside enclosed regions bounded by colored walls.
- Border legends: small rectangles on the grid edge whose fill color C matches a region's border color. Each legend contains a center dot and an indicator dot encoding a direction.

Rule:
- For each enclosed region, identify its border color C and look up the legend with fill color C.
- The direction from the legend's center dot to its indicator dot gives the slide direction.
- All yellow pixels in that region slide in that direction, stacking against the far wall.

Key insight: Legend fill color links to region border color; the center→indicator offset encodes the movement vector.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
