Compress the stacked colored bars into a compact ordered table with the control pixel on the selected row.

Input structure
- A background grid contains several full-width colored bars from top to
  bottom; the last bar is the base/separator color.
- Each non-base bar may have an aligned three-column comb motif below it,
  alternating side-pair rows with solid rows.
- A singleton control pixel sits away from the colored motifs.

Rule
- Make one output row per non-base bar, preserving top-to-bottom order.
- In that row, paint the bar color once for each solid three-pixel row in
  its motif, then paint the base-bar color in the separator column.
- The singleton control pixel sits immediately above the base bar. Among
  motifs whose open side-pair parity is compatible with that bottom row,
  put the control pixel in the output row with the fewest solid rows; use
  horizontal distance to the motif center only to break count ties.

Key insight
- The vertical comb height is a count, while the control pixel is read by
  projecting it onto the center gap of compatible comb rows rather than by
  its vertical band alone.

Assemble colored sprites into a central bar's notches, chaining successive pieces along fixed-width strips.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Largest monochrome component is a solid "bar" with boundary notches (bg holes opening to its bbox edge).
- Several smaller colored sprites scattered around the bar.

Rule:
- Each bar notch is filled by a root piece whose shape exactly covers the hole.
- The root defines a strip (column-span or row-span) for its chain.
- Successive pieces fill the bg cells inside the previous piece's bbox, locked to the same strip width.
- Multiple chains grow independently from different bar notches.

Key insight: The root piece's extent perpendicular to the chain direction locks the strip width for all subsequent pieces in that chain.

Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

Fill hollow sprites' interiors using a color-palette legend on the grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Several hollow sprites with distinct border colors.
- A small 2×N or N×2 palette block sits on one grid edge; one row/column lists border colors, the other lists corresponding fill colors.

Rule:
- Locate the palette legend on a grid edge and read it as a border→fill color mapping.
- Find enclosed bg regions (holes) inside sprites that don't touch the grid boundary.
- For each hole, identify the most common adjacent border color, look it up in the palette, and fill the hole with the mapped fill color.

Key insight: The palette's edge position and orientation determine reading direction; border colors in the palette uniquely key into fill colors.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

<description>
Combine each column's repeated template mask with its single solid color swatch.

Input structure:
- The grid is a table of framed panels separated by background rows/columns.
- The leftmost column gives one solid row-label color for each panel row.
- In each panel column, exactly one panel has a solid non-background interior,
  while the other panels share the same mask drawn in one template color on
  the background.

Rule:
- For every panel column, find the row containing the solid interior swatch.
- Rebuild one output panel using that row's left label as the frame color.
- Fill the repeated template mask with the swatch color and leave the mask
  background cells as background; separate rebuilt panels with one
  background column.

Key insight:
The table encodes a colorized stencil per column: the solid panel supplies
the paint color and frame label, while the duplicate template panels supply
the shape mask.

Complete every colored sprite by applying the union of all aligned partial sprite masks.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each non-background color appears as a separated partial copy of one common sprite mask.
- The copies share a top-left-aligned sprite window; some copies may be missing lower or right edge pixels.

Rule:
- Crop each same-color mask to its bounding box.
- Pad the crops to the maximum observed height and width, aligned at the top-left, and OR them into one complete template.
- Fill that template at every sprite location using the sprite's own color.

Key insight:
- No single input sprite is complete, but their missing cells are complementary, so the aligned union reveals the full mask.

Connect two sprites using matching connector pixels, then tight-crop.

Input structure:
- Background color `bg`, sprite color `obj`, connector color `ctrl` (small, 2 components).
- Two main foreground sprites, plus possibly tiny detached pixels belonging to one sprite.

Rule:
- Identify the **base** sprite (closest to grid top-left).
- Translate the other sprite so its connector sits one cell above the base's connector.
- Stamp the plug onto the base; remove connectors (recolor `ctrl` to `obj`).
- Output is the tight crop around all non-background pixels.

Key insight: The connector pixels define the unique docking point and direction.

Decode a block-grid image by swapping each sprite-coded cell with a solid cell and each blank cell with the sprite.

Input structure
The grid is partitioned by black separator rows and columns into equal-size
square blocks. Each block is either a copy of one two-color sprite or a
uniform blank block of the sprite's minority color; grey pixels are erased
cells that act as wildcards.

Rule
Infer the repeated sprite from fully visible mixed-color blocks. Replace a
block matching that sprite, ignoring grey erasures, with a solid block of
the sprite's majority color. Replace a uniform blank block with the sprite.
Separator rows and columns, including grey erasures on them, become black.

Key insight
The small sprite is a block-level code for one macro-cell state, and the
uniform minority-color block is the other state; the output renders the
opposite code in each macro-cell while cleaning erased pixels.

Dock two-tone sprites into color-matched horizontal bars with a color swap.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top area: small two-tone sprites (outer color + inner color).
- Below: horizontal bars spanning most of the row, each with a fill color and border color on edges.

Rule:
- Match each sprite to the bar whose fill color equals the sprite's outer color.
- Place the sprite at its original x-position, aligned to the bar's bottom.
- Recolor: sprite outer → bar border, sprite inner → bar fill.
- Erase original sprites from the top area.

Key insight: Color matching is inverted — the sprite's dominant color identifies its target bar, then gets swapped to the bar's accent color.

Replace a corner L with a same-color right-triangle outline in the corresponding corner of an enlarged canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a square grid with one background color and one foreground color.
- The foreground is a one-pixel-thick L inside a square bbox.
- The L touches exactly one horizontal grid edge and one vertical grid edge, identifying a corner.

Rule:
- Fill a square output canvas of side 3n-2, where n is the input side length, with the background color.
- Double the L leg length to get the triangle side length.
- Draw the two perpendicular triangle legs on the same output corner edges and connect their free endpoints with the diagonal.

Key insight:
- The input L encodes the corner, color, and side length of the triangle outline; the missing side is the diagonal between the L's two free endpoints.

Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Recolor grey shapes by matching their hole count to a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; grey (5) sprites scattered across the grid.
- Colored legend shapes (non-bg, non-grey, at least 2×2, not touching the outer border) near grid edge,
  each with a distinct number of enclosed holes.

Rule:
- Each colored legend shape defines a mapping: hole count → color.
- For every grey sprite, count its holes (enclosed bg regions not touching the sprite's bounding-box border).
- Recolor the grey sprite to the matching legend color; erase grey distractors with unlisted hole counts.

Key insight: Shape identity is encoded by topology (number of holes), not geometry or size.

Recolor each non-singleton red object by its symmetry axis and erase isolated red pixels.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and red 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every non-singleton red object has exactly one reflection symmetry category:
  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- Single red pixels are noise.

Rule:
- Start from an all-background output of the same shape.
- Recolor horizontally symmetric red objects blue, vertically symmetric objects
  green, and diagonally symmetric objects pink.
- Leave isolated red pixels as background.

Key insight: The target color is not tied to object position or size; it is a
label for the object's reflection symmetry.

Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

Rotate each magenta source pixel 90 degrees counterclockwise around its matched blue pivot, recoloring the new pixel orange.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are blue pivot pixels and magenta source pixels.
- Each magenta source can be paired one-to-one with a blue pivot in the same
  row or column.

Rule:
- Remove all magenta source pixels.
- For each matched source/pivot pair, preserve the source distance from the
  pivot but rotate its offset 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Paint the rotated in-bounds target orange; if the target is outside the
  grid, the source simply disappears.

Key insight:
The blue pixels are rotation centers, and row/column alignment gives a
unique global matching from each magenta source to its pivot.

Keep only the center color and redraw it as a diagonal ray to its indicated corner.

Input structure:
- The grid is an odd square with a unique dominant background color.
- The center pixel is foreground.
- Every off-center pixel with the center color lies in the same diagonal
  quadrant relative to the center.

Rule:
- Fill the whole output with the background color.
- Use the quadrant of the center-colored pixels to choose one diagonal
  direction from the center.
- Draw a continuous line of the center color from the center to the grid
  edge in that direction.

Key insight:
The color at the exact center identifies the surviving color, while the
other pixels of that color identify which corner the center should connect to.

Extract the top-left or top-right 2x2 corner crop selected by the top edge clue.

Input structure
- The input is a square color grid whose answer is one of the two 2x2 crops
  touching the top edge and a grid corner.
- A repeated color on the top row, when present, acts as the primary side cue.
- Otherwise, the two top corner colors have different whole-grid frequencies.

Rule
- If a top-row color repeats, find the repeated top-row occurrence nearest to
  a left or right edge and take the 2x2 top-corner crop on that side.
- If the top row has no repeated color, compare the whole-grid frequencies of
  the two top-corner colors and take the side whose corner color is rarer.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for an arbitrary 2x2 search: the decisive information
  is on the top edge, and it selects which top corner crop to keep.

Repeat the single colored border segment around the rectangular border, leaving one segment-length gap between copies.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is exactly one foreground color.
- All foreground pixels form one contiguous segment on the rectangular border, possibly crossing the cycle start.

Rule:
- Unwrap the grid border clockwise into a cyclic path.
- Let n be the length of the foreground segment.
- Copy the segment with the same color every 2*n border positions around the cycle.

Key insight:
- The foreground segment is not extended by rows or columns directly; it is a motif on the perimeter cycle, repeated with an equal-sized gap.

Draw the marker-colored route through the centers of all doors in the parallel wall maze.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background, parallel full-span walls, one three-pixel door
  segment in each wall, and two marker pixels sharing a color.
- Walls are either all vertical or all horizontal, and the markers are on
  opposite outer sides of the wall set.

Rule:
- Keep the scene unchanged except for the route.
- Visit the door centers in wall order from the upper/left marker side to
  the lower/right marker side.
- In each corridor, draw an orthogonal path to the cell just before the next
  wall, move along that wall to the door center, cross the center, and
  continue to the next corridor; after the last door, connect to the other
  marker.

Key insight:
- The three-pixel door segments mark the only crossing points through a set
  of parallel walls, so the output is the corridor path threaded through
  those centers.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
