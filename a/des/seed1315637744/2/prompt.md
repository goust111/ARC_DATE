Extract the central object from the marker cluster whose markers have the same color.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background and several clusters; each cluster has four
same-color corner marker objects around one central monochromatic object.
Rule
Find every central object enclosed by four aligned corner markers of one color,
then choose the unique one whose object color equals the marker color.
Key insight
The answer is not the largest or most frequent object; it is the center of the
self-colored cluster, cropped to that object's bounding box with background kept.

Reconstruct the repeated tile from its separated copies and mark the missing pixels in the damaged copy blue.

Input structure:
- The input is a lattice of equal-size blocks separated by one-cell solid rows
  and columns of the same separator color.
- All blocks are copies of one motif except exactly one block, where some
  motif pixels have been overwritten by the motif background color.
- Blue is absent from the input and is reserved as the output marker color.

Rule:
- Recover the motif by taking the unique majority color at each local block
  coordinate across all block copies.
- Find the single block that differs from this consensus motif.
- Return the consensus motif, recoloring the differing local coordinates blue.

Key insight:
- The repeated copies provide redundancy: the damaged positions are exactly
  the coordinates where the lone nonconforming copy has background instead of
  the consensus motif color.

Summarize the enclosed table slots by the single object color inside each slot, using the slot background color for empty slots.

Input structure
- The most common color forms the outer background and all enclosed slot
  backgrounds.
- The enclosed background components form a complete rectangular array of
  slots, ordered by their positions.
- Each slot contains either no other color or exactly one object color.

Rule
- Find all 4-connected components of the most common color that do not touch
  the input edge.
- Sort their bounding boxes into row and column order to define the output
  table.
- For each slot, output its unique non-background color if present; otherwise
  output the background color.

Key insight
- The large grid is an expanded table: the enclosed background components are
  the cells, and any colored object drawn inside a cell is that cell's summary
  value.

Convert each colored partitioned frame into a horizontal bar whose length is its number of enclosed regions.

Input structure:
- Black background with several axis-aligned colored line drawings.
- The line drawings are damaged by scattered pixels of one non-background noise color and by overlaps with other drawings.
- Each real drawing is a rectangular partitioned frame enclosing one or more background regions.

Rule:
- For each non-background color, reconstruct its horizontal and vertical wall segments from dense row/column evidence.
- Count the 4-connected background regions fully enclosed by those reconstructed walls.
- The color with no enclosed region is the noise/pad color.
- Sort drawing colors by enclosed-region count; equal counts are ordered by which reconstructed frame covers the other.

Key insight:
- The scattered color is not an object; it only pads the histogram, while each true object's room count is stable after rectilinear wall reconstruction.

Move each gray bar into its adjacent orange rectangle as full stripes from the contacted edge.

Input structure
- The scene uses black outside space, yellow fill, gray one-cell-thick bars, and solid orange rectangles.
- Each gray bar 4-touches exactly one orange rectangle; some orange rectangles have no touching gray bar.
- Gray bars touching the same orange rectangle all have the same orientation.

Rule
- Recolor every original gray cell to yellow.
- For each orange rectangle touched by gray bars, count the gray cells assigned to that rectangle.
- Horizontal gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange rows starting from the contacted top or bottom row.
- Vertical gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange columns starting from the contacted left or right column.
- Orange rectangles with no touching gray bar remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The gray pixels are not copied by shape; their count is transferred into the neighboring orange rectangle as edge-aligned row or column stripes.

Recolor the grey diagonal-chain regions in an orange field to teal.

Input structure
The input contains only grey pixels and orange pixels.  Grey pixels form
several 8-connected regions embedded in the orange field.

Rule
Decompose each grey 8-connected region into 4-connected lobes.  Recolor the
whole region teal only when it contains a straight diagonal run of at least
three pixels and those lobes meet only by diagonal corner contacts in a
non-branching diagonal chain or cycle; a single 4-connected region is
recolored only when it is a square diagonal staircase.

Key insight
The teal regions are not selected by size or position; they are the grey
regions whose internal connectivity depends on diagonal corner joins, while
same-edge cracks, rectangles, bars, and branching/noisy regions remain grey.

Rotate the colors around every 3x3 foreground ring, with corners and side-centers cycling in opposite directions.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Each 4-connected foreground object is a complete 3x3 ring: eight foreground pixels around a background center.

Rule
- For each ring, move corner colors one step around the four corners.
- Move side-center colors one step around the four side centers in the opposite direction.
- Leave the background center and all other background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Corners and side centers form two separate four-cycles on the same 3x3 ring.

Extract the hidden two-color image by compacting the rows and columns of its complete mask.

Input structure
The grid contains one pair of colors whose pixels occupy every cell in the
cross product of their active rows and active columns; all other colors form
the surrounding filler or separators.
Rule
Find that unique color pair, keep exactly the rows and columns touched by
the pair, and return the induced subgrid.
Key insight
The target image is not chosen by color id; it is the only two-color mask
whose occupied pixels form a full rectangular row/column product after
deleting unused rows and columns.

Use the pink control pixel to choose where the maroon pixel belongs inside the grey 3x3 region, and turn the control pixel maroon.

Input structure:
- The grid contains one 3x3 region made from eight grey pixels and one maroon pixel.
- There is exactly one pink control pixel outside that region.

Rule:
- Restore the old maroon cell in the 3x3 region to grey.
- Compare the pink pixel to the 3x3 region: above/same band/below selects top/middle/bottom, and left/same band/right selects left/middle/right.
- Paint the selected cell maroon and recolor the pink control pixel maroon.

Key insight:
- The pink pixel acts as a relative-position marker for a 3x3 target inside the grey region.

Drop the singleton marker into the matching red U-shaped container, or make a bottom-row puddle if no closed container is hit.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one singleton marker pixel on the top row,
  and one other foreground color forming vertical bars and bottom segments.
- A closed container is a U shape: two vertical side bars with a continuous
  bottom segment between them and an empty rectangular interior above the bottom.

Rule
- Remove the top marker from its original cell.
- If exactly one closed U-shaped container has the marker column within its
  horizontal footprint, fill that container's empty interior with the marker color.
- If no closed container is under the marker column, fill the whole bottom row
  with the marker color.

Key insight
- The marker does not identify a color by value; it identifies a vertical drop
  column, and only a structurally closed U shape can catch and contain the fill.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

Move each source pixel toward the separator when it matches its aligned reference pixel, otherwise to the far edge.

Input structure:
- A single full separator line is part of a rectangular frame; the frame's
  extra cells mark the reference side.
- On the reference side, one row or column of colored pixels is aligned
  with one row or column of source pixels on the opposite side.
- Each side has its own dominant background color.

Rule:
- Compare each source pixel with the reference pixel on the same row or column.
- If their colors match, place the source pixel in the cell adjacent to the
  separator on the source side.
- If their colors differ, place the source pixel on the far outer edge along
  the same row or column.
- Erase the original source pixels to the source-side background; keep the
  frame and reference pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The extra frame cells identify which side is the reference; equality with the
aligned reference pixel decides whether each source pixel moves inward or outward.

Recolor the separated outer regions by rotating their colors one step clockwise around the yellow-orange divider.

Input structure:
- The grid contains a fixed yellow/orange divider structure.
- All other colors form separated 4-connected monochrome regions around that divider.

Rule:
- Leave the yellow and orange pixels unchanged.
- Sort the non-divider regions by their centroid angle around the divider centroid in screen-coordinate clockwise order.
- Each region keeps its cells and receives the color of the previous region in that cyclic order.

Key insight:
- The objects do not move; only the color labels cycle through the spatial order of the regions around the divider.

Summarize the foreground line objects as ordered horizontal color stripes.

Input structure:
- A dominant background fills a rectangular grid.
- Each non-background color forms one contiguous one-cell-thick line segment.
- The line segments have distinct topmost rows, and there are at most five of
  them.

Rule:
- Sort the foreground colors by the topmost row occupied by their line
  segment.
- Create a 5x3 output filled with the background color.
- Place one solid 1x3 row for each foreground color, preserving that
  top-to-bottom order and padding any unused rows above with background.

Key insight: The exact line length and slope do not matter; only the
vertical order of the colored line segments is encoded in the output stack.

Mirror the smallest non-axis foreground color across the full straight axis.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color forms exactly one full row, column, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal reflection axis.
- The remaining foreground colors include a unique least-populated color to copy.

Rule
- Preserve the input grid.
- Select every pixel of the unique smallest non-axis foreground color.
- Reflect those pixels across the full straight axis and paint the reflected positions with the same color.

Key insight
- The axis color marks the mirror line, while the color population chooses which set of objects is duplicated.

Dock movable tools into border-anchored frames by filling cavities.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Border-touching components cluster into anchor frames with interior bg cavities.
- Non-border 2-color components are movable tools.

Rule:
- Match each tool to a frame whose cavity size equals one of its color-region counts.
- Rotate/flip the tool so one color fills the cavity exactly; the other stays outside.
- If the docking orientation uses a reflection, swap the tool's two colors.

Key insight: Cavity size determines tool–frame pairing; reflection triggers color swap.

Extract the lattice subregion bounded by the four background-colored corner holes.

Input structure:
- A regular one-cell-thick lattice has one line color, one background color,
  and sparse marker pixels.
- Exactly four lattice-line intersections are background-colored holes instead
  of line-color pixels.

Rule:
- Find the unique non-background color that forms regular horizontal and
  vertical lattice lines.
- Use the four background-colored lattice intersections as the corners of one
  rectangle.
- Return the inclusive crop between those corner rows and columns.

Key insight:
- The crop is marked by the missing lattice intersections, not by the marker
  pixels inside the cells.

Decode the colored 3x3 contour motif into a 16x16 periodic lattice with the motif stamped in maroon at the center.

Input structure:
- The grid is 6x6 with orange background and one non-orange color.
- The non-orange pixels have a tight 3x3 bbox containing one contour glyph.
- The glyph is one of the task's period-3 contour forms: plus, H, X, or four corners.

Rule:
- Decode the 3x3 glyph into the period-3 orange phase tile.
- Fill a black 16x16 canvas by repeating that orange phase tile.
- Tile the original 3x3 glyph 2x2 and recolor its true pixels to maroon in the centered 6x6 region.

Key insight:
- The colored object is not copied at its input location; it is a small contour code whose phase tells where orange appears in the repeated lattice.

Fill each centered square ring with the color of the marker at that ring distance.

Input structure
The input is an odd square grid with a dominant background color and one
non-background marker for every Chebyshev distance from the grid center.
Rule
The output replaces the background with concentric square rings centered on
the middle cell; every cell at distance d from the center takes the color of
the unique marker whose distance from the center is d.
Key insight
The scattered markers are not objects to move; their Chebyshev distances
form a palette for the centered square rings.

Complete the scene by adding the point-reflected copy of the colored object across the central marker.

Input structure
- The grid has odd dimensions, a dominant background, and a center-row marker color appearing only at the left edge, center, and right edge.
- A single divider color fills the center column except for the center marker.
- All remaining foreground pixels form the object to copy, entirely on the left side of the divider.
Rule
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For every object pixel, paint the pixel rotated 180 degrees around the center marker with the same color.
Key insight
- The center marker is the rotation center; the yellow-looking divider is not mirrored, it only separates the source from the empty target side.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
