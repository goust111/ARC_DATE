Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Swap every sprite to the opposite prototype while preserving scale and position.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Two distinct small sprite patterns (prototypes) appear at various scales.
- Each sprite instance is a scaled copy of one of the two prototypes, placed on the grid.

Rule:
- Identify the two prototype patterns from the smallest-area sprites.
- For each sprite, determine which prototype it matches and its integer scale factor.
- Replace it with the other prototype at the same scale, aligned by an internal anchor region (color-1 pixels).

Key insight: Every sprite toggles to the alternate prototype; the anchor sub-region inside each sprite pins the alignment so swapped sprites land in the correct position regardless of scale.

Keep the larger sprite from each separated panel and overlay those sprites into one 5x5 canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a 5x17 grid: three 5x5 panels separated by one-cell black columns.
- Each panel has the same background color and exactly one foreground color split into two 4-connected components.

Rule:
- In each panel, discard the smaller foreground component and keep the unique largest component as the sprite.
- Process panels left to right, placing each sprite at its panel coordinates on a 5x5 background canvas.
- If a sprite would cover an already placed sprite, slide it by the unique nearest in-bounds offset that avoids overlap.

Key insight:
- The extra same-colored component in each panel is a distractor; the final answer is the non-overlapping overlay of the three largest components.

<description>
Drop the singleton marker into the matching red U-shaped container, or make a bottom-row puddle if no closed container is hit.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one singleton marker pixel on the top row,
  and one other foreground color forming vertical bars and bottom segments.
- A closed container is a U shape: two vertical side bars with a continuous
  bottom segment between them and an empty rectangular interior above the bottom.

Rule
- Remove the top marker from its original cell.
- If exactly one closed U-shaped container has the marker column within its
  horizontal footprint, fill that container's empty interior with the marker color.
- If no closed container is under the marker column, fill the whole bottom row
  with the marker color.

Key insight
- The marker does not identify a color by value; it identifies a vertical drop
  column, and only a structurally closed U shape can catch and contain the fill.

<description>
Untangle overlapping colored rectangular frames into concentric square frames ordered by their visible crossings.

Input structure
- The background contains several one-cell-thick axis-aligned rectangular frames, one color per frame.
- Frames overlap, and the visible color at an overlap records a directed crossing from the hidden frame to the visible frame.
- Each foreground color still has visible pixels on the perimeter of its full rectangular bounding box.

Rule
- Infer each color's full rectangular frame from the bounding box of its visible pixels.
- Add a directed edge A -> B when B is visible at a crossing of A and B's frame perimeters.
- Find the unique path that visits every frame color once, then render those colors as one-pixel-thick concentric square frames from outside to inside.

Key insight
- The output is not a crop of the input; the crossing graph gives a single frame order, and that order is redrawn as nested rings.

Count colored objects and record tallies inside a legend box.

Input structure:
- A black rectangular legend box with key-color pixels in its leftmost non-black column.
- Outside the box, distinct objects of each key color are scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- For each key color, count separate same-colored objects outside the legend box.
- Output the legend box repainted: each key row gets one dot per object, spaced every other cell rightward from the key pixel.

Key insight: The legend is both the color index and the output canvas — object counts become dot sequences on the matching row.

Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Complete a grid of colored blocks to match a minimap legend in the top-left corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top-left corner: a small sprite of single colored pixels forming a minimap pattern on a regular lattice.
- Main area: uniformly colored square blocks (NxN) arranged on a regular grid; some positions are empty (bg).

Rule:
- The legend pixels define a color pattern; each pixel's lattice position maps to a block position in the main grid via a fixed scale factor and offset.
- Existing colored blocks confirm the scale/offset alignment.
- For every legend pixel whose corresponding grid position is empty, place a new block of that color.

Key insight: The top-left pixel pattern is a scaled-down minimap of the block layout; the mapping is inferred from blocks already present.

Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

Align parallel colored line segments so they all share the same start and end positions as a reference line.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several parallel line segments (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical), each a different color, running in the same direction but starting/ending at different positions.

Rule:
- Detect the dominant direction shared by all segments.
- Pick the median segment (by perpendicular offset) as the reference.
- Shift every segment along the shared direction so its start aligns with the reference's start, then trim or extend it to match the reference's length.
- Grid size stays the same; isolated single pixels are untouched.

Key insight: The reference is the median line, not the longest; all segments are snapped to its extent regardless of their original length.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Complete the sparse colored marker pattern by reflecting it across a full-row/full-column cross.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background and one non-background cross color that
fills exactly one complete row and one complete column. All other foreground
pixels are sparse markers away from that cross.

Rule
Keep the input unchanged, and for each marker pixel copy its color to the
positions obtained by reflecting it across the cross row, across the cross
column, and across both axes. Reflected positions outside the grid are
clipped.

Key insight
The full cross is not a copied object; it is the pair of mirror axes for
completing the quadrant pattern.

Normalize vertical two-color bars between paired marker columns around the marker rows.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- A row of red marker pixels sits directly above a row of gray marker pixels
  in the same alternating columns.
- The columns between adjacent markers contain vertical bars made from a
  contiguous teal run above a contiguous blue run.

Rule
- Keep the marker pixels and all non-bar background cells fixed.
- Let h be the maximum teal-run height among the bar columns; paint teal in
  every bar column for h rows ending at the red marker row.
- In each bar column, move its blue run to start at the gray marker row and
  fill all lower cells in that column with maroon.

Key insight
- The marker rows are a baseline: teal is normalized into a common upper
  band, while each blue run keeps its own height below the baseline.

Extend row bars periodically across the opposite side of a separator column.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A near-solid vertical separator divides the grid into two sides.
- One side contains horizontal colored bars; the other side is blank target space.
- Bars may be stacked by row and may sit at different distances from the separator.

Rule:
- Identify the separator as the column whose non-bg cells are one color.
- Treat the denser side as the bar side and collect each contiguous row run.
- Process bars from nearest to farthest from the separator; for each bar, paint its
  color every bar-length cells into the blank side without overwriting earlier paint.

Key insight: Each bar's length is the period for its extension, and nearer bars claim target cells first.

Replicate a pre-drawn corner pattern to every other marker-bearing corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most frequent color. Hollow 0-frames (possibly partial L-shapes); each
  frame-corner cell is either 0 or a painted (non-bg, non-0) color.
- >= 1 'source' corner: the pattern is already drawn (one color, both outward
  cells and an inward-diagonal trail).
- Other corners: a single colored pixel on the inward diagonal at the pattern's
  deepest (k,k) offset; the pixel's color is that corner's target color.

Rule:
- Extract the canonical (TL-oriented) pattern from any source.
- For each non-source corner whose marker cell is colored, paint the same
  pattern rotated to that corner's orientation, using the marker's color.

Key insight: the pattern is symmetric about the corner's inward-diagonal axis
(canonical dr == dc), so it reflects cleanly across all four corner orientations.
Painting uses each target's OWN marker color, not the source color.

Sort objects to top or bottom edge by whether their shape (up to rotation/flip) is shared.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several multicolor connected components (8-connected) scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Compute each object's canonical shape (binary mask, invariant to rotation and flip).
- Objects whose shape appears in two or more components → translate to TOP edge (row 0).
- Objects whose shape is unique → translate to BOTTOM edge (row H−h).
- Horizontal position (left column) is preserved; only vertical translation changes.

Key insight: The sorting criterion is shape frequency (rotation-invariant), not area — duplicated shapes go up, unique shapes go down.

Grow an alternating pink/orange triangular trace downward from the horizontal orange seed row.

Input structure:
- The grid has a green background and one horizontal row containing all orange foreground pixels.
- The seed row may contain isolated orange pixels and adjacent orange runs.
- Pink is absent from the input and is used for the first generated row.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- Two rows below the current active row, place a child pixel between each active pair
  whose middle cell in the current row is background.
- Alternate generated row colors between pink and orange, stopping when no children
  can be generated or the next row would leave the grid.

Key insight:
- Only an active-background-active triplet in the current row reproduces; contiguous
  active runs do not produce children through occupied middle cells.

Count same-color patterns per frame and represent the tally as dots inside.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Hollow rectangular frames in various colors.
- Small monochrome pattern sprites scattered outside frames.

Rule:
- Remove all small patterns from the grid.
- For each frame of color C, count how many patterns share color C.
- Draw that many dots along the frame's center row, spaced by 2, starting from the right.

Key insight: Frames act as tally displays — scattered same-color patterns are "absorbed" and their count is shown as interior dots.

Move the side-attached foreground object to the opposite wall, shear its lower rows inward, and paint the crossed floor cells.

Input structure:
- The top row is the upper background color and the bottom row is the
  floor color.
- A single non-background, non-floor object touches exactly one vertical
  grid edge and rests immediately above the first solid floor row.

Rule:
- Clear the source object to the upper background color.
- Repaint each object row on the opposite side: the first three relative
  rows keep the edge alignment, and each lower row shifts one more pixel
  inward from that side.
- On the first floor row, repaint the traversed side-to-object segment
  maroon, stopping just before the final outer bottom support pixel.

Key insight:
- The side of the source object gives the horizontal direction, while the
  row index inside the object gives the one-cell-per-row diagonal shear.

Compress the stacked colored bars into a compact ordered table with the control pixel on the selected row.

Input structure
- A background grid contains several full-width colored bars from top to
  bottom; the last bar is the base/separator color.
- Each non-base bar may have an aligned three-column comb motif below it,
  alternating side-pair rows with solid rows.
- A singleton control pixel sits away from the colored motifs.

Rule
- Make one output row per non-base bar, preserving top-to-bottom order.
- In that row, paint the bar color once for each solid three-pixel row in
  its motif, then paint the base-bar color in the separator column.
- The singleton control pixel sits immediately above the base bar. Among
  motifs whose open side-pair parity is compatible with that bottom row,
  put the control pixel in the output row with the fewest solid rows; use
  horizontal distance to the motif center only to break count ties.

Key insight
- The vertical comb height is a count, while the control pixel is read by
  projecting it onto the center gap of compatible comb rows rather than by
  its vertical band alone.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
