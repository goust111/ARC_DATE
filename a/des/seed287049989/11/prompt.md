Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

Rewrite a corner L block into two nested L borders and a diagonal trace.

Input structure
A rectangular grid has exactly two colors: one color forms a one-cell-thick
L on two adjacent outer edges, and the other color fills the remaining
rectangle.

Rule
Normalize the L to the top-left corner. Paint the outer top-left L with the
fill color, the next inner L with the original border color, and the main
diagonal of the remaining inner rectangle with the fill color. All other
cells become color 8, then the original orientation is restored.

Key insight
The corner of the input L determines the orientation; after flipping to a
canonical top-left L, the output is the same nested-layer pattern for every
example.

Keep only the center color and redraw it as a diagonal ray to its indicated corner.

Input structure:
- The grid is an odd square with a unique dominant background color.
- The center pixel is foreground.
- Every off-center pixel with the center color lies in the same diagonal
  quadrant relative to the center.

Rule:
- Fill the whole output with the background color.
- Use the quadrant of the center-colored pixels to choose one diagonal
  direction from the center.
- Draw a continuous line of the center color from the center to the grid
  edge in that direction.

Key insight:
The color at the exact center identifies the surviving color, while the
other pixels of that color identify which corner the center should connect to.

Connect two sprites using matching connector pixels, then tight-crop.

Input structure:
- Background color `bg`, sprite color `obj`, connector color `ctrl` (small, 2 components).
- Two main foreground sprites, plus possibly tiny detached pixels belonging to one sprite.

Rule:
- Identify the **base** sprite (closest to grid top-left).
- Translate the other sprite so its connector sits one cell above the base's connector.
- Stamp the plug onto the base; remove connectors (recolor `ctrl` to `obj`).
- Output is the tight crop around all non-background pixels.

Key insight: The connector pixels define the unique docking point and direction.

Use local source-target-pattern examples to replace matching source pixels.

Input structure:
- Black background with isolated colored pixels and teal (8) pattern components.
- A rule example is a 4-neighbor colored pair source->target whose continued
  direction reaches an anchor touching a teal pattern component.

Rule:
- For each rule example, copy that teal component onto every other pixel of
  source.color, recoloring the copied component to target.color.
- Translation maps the rule anchor onto the source pixel being replaced.
- Remove teal components and all pixels used by rule examples.

Key insight: The two adjacent colored pixels define the color substitution and
the anchor point; the nearby teal component is the stencil that gets recolored.

Fill every lattice slot from the color assigned to that slot position by the other lattices.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The largest foreground color forms several one-pixel-thick rectangular lattice frames.
- The frame lines divide each lattice into the same row-by-column set of rectangular slots; some slots already contain one non-frame color.

Rule:
- Infer a color for each logical slot position from the colored slots across all lattice frames.
- Repaint every slot interior in every lattice with the inferred color for its row/column position.
- Keep the frame lines and all background outside frames unchanged.

Key insight:
- Slot sizes vary by frame, but the complete color pattern is indexed by lattice slot position rather than by absolute pixel size or location.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Stamp recolored sprites into a framed region using placeholder positions and a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg background, a rectangular single-color frame, colored placeholder cells inside the frame.
- Outside the frame: sprite shapes (one per placeholder color) and a small legend mapping each placeholder color to an output color.

Rule:
- Find the frame and its interior placeholders.
- For each placeholder color, locate the matching-color sprite outside the frame.
- Stamp each sprite at the placeholder's position inside the frame.
- Recolor every stamped sprite to the output color defined by the legend.

Key insight: The legend pairs (overlapping two-color glyphs outside the frame) dictate the final recoloring — placeholder color selects the shape, legend maps it to the output color.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Extend each solid foreground rectangle toward its same-color isolated pixels with capped one-cell paths, clearing each original marker pixel.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground color has exactly one solid rectangular object and one or more isolated same-color marker pixels.
- Every marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the rectangle bbox and lies outside it.
Rule
- For each marker, draw a one-cell-wide straight path from the adjacent side of the rectangle through one cell beyond the marker.
- Add a three-pixel perpendicular cap at the rectangle end and around the marker endpoint.
- Recolor the original marker pixel to background.
Key insight
- The isolated pixels are not copied; they mark the hollow endpoints of capped protrusions grown from their matching rectangle.

Predict the next panel in a framed sequence by continuing each scheduled colored interval.

Input structure
- The grid is made from three or more equal panels in one row or one column.
- The final input panel is the static target template; every earlier panel differs from it only by dynamic colors absent from the template.
- Each dynamic color appears in a regular temporal schedule across the earlier panels.

Rule
- Keep the final template panel as the output canvas.
- For every dynamic color whose schedule reaches the next panel, compare its last two appearances.
- Extrapolate each one-dimensional interval along the color's changing row or column axis and paint that predicted mask.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for the last visible panel, but for the next frame after the blank/template slot.

Scale up a monochrome control sprite by stamping a polychrome tile at each filled pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = background color.
- Two foreground objects (8-connected): a monochrome rectangular sprite with bg holes (control), and a polychrome square tile (block).

Rule:
- For each cell in the control sprite's bbox: if filled, stamp a copy of the block tile; if bg, leave a tile-sized bg region.
- Output grid dimensions are (control_h × tile_h) by (control_w × tile_w).

Key insight: The control sprite acts as a binary mask that gets "pixel-scaled" by the tile — each pixel expands to a full tile copy or empty space.

Let the largest center-pointing object grow outward while every other object loses its inward tip.

Input structure
- The grid has a single dominant background color and four 8-connected monochromatic foreground objects.
- The objects surround a central background gap and point toward it from cardinal directions.
- Exactly one object has the largest area.

Rule
- Find the central background gap by minimizing aggregate distance to the four objects.
- Recolor the nearest-to-center pixel of each non-largest object to background.
- Add a three-pixel cap in the largest object's color on the side away from the center, centered on the shared row or column.

Key insight
- The edit is a transfer of prominence around a common center: losers retract at their tips, and the unique largest object extends outward from the center.

Transmit colored tokens along wire networks, converting each to its complementary 3×3 pattern.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Non-bg cells form wire networks and 3×3 tokens (solid blocks or X/diagonal patterns) near wire endpoints.

Rule:
- Every solid 3×3 token is replaced in-place by a diamond (center + 4 cardinal neighbors).
- Each token near a wire endpoint sends its complement to the opposite endpoint: solid emits X, X emits diamond.

Key insight: Token shape cycles solid → X → diamond; wires route each complement to the far end.

Move each gray marker along its green path until it reaches the cell next to a black-green-black gate, erasing the path behind it.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground components are made from a path color, a paired gate-end color, and single marker pixels.
- A gate is a straight end-center-end motif whose center has the path color and whose two ends share the gate-end color.

Rule:
- In every 4-connected foreground component with exactly one marker and one gate, erase the marker and all path-color pixels except the gate center.
- Place the marker on the unique path-color pixel adjacent to the gate center but not between the two gate ends.
- Components without both a marker and a gate stay unchanged.

Key insight: The black-green-black motif marks the stopping gate; the gray marker consumes the connected green path until it rests on the path cell immediately beside that gate.

Shift each interior pixel whose color matches a frame side one cell toward that matching side.

Input structure
The grid has a one-cell-thick rectangular frame: the four corners are the
background color, and each side between corners is a solid, distinct side
color. The interior is mostly background with sparse foreground pixels.

Rule
Interior pixels with the top-side color move one row up, bottom-side color
move one row down, left-side color move one column left, and right-side color
move one column right. A pixel already adjacent to its matching side stays in
place; colors that do not match a frame side and the frame itself are unchanged.

Key insight
The colored frame sides act as direction labels for matching interior pixels.

Replace each marker below the separator with the mapped top legend square centered on that marker.

Input structure:
- The background surrounds a top legend, one solid non-background separator row, and a lower marker field.
- The legend contains equal-size filled square sprites, with a singleton marker below each sprite and aligned to its center column.
- The lower field contains only background and marker colors from the legend.

Rule:
- Pair legend markers to legend sprites by left-to-right position.
- Discard the legend and separator; keep the grid width and the rows below the separator.
- In the lower field, replace every marker pixel by a filled square of the paired sprite color, centered at the marker location.

Key insight: The top area is a positional color legend, and the actual output is the post-separator marker field expanded by that legend.

Fill the small background compartments bounded by the long contour color.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and two foreground colors.
- The more frequent foreground color forms long 8-connected contour fragments.
- The other foreground color is a fixed distractor/obstacle color that partitions
  the background but is never recolored.

Rule:
- Split the background into 4-connected regions using all foreground pixels as
  barriers.
- Keep the two largest background regions as the outside of the contour drawing.
- Recolor every other background region that touches a long contour component
  to the contour color; leave all foreground pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The apparent area fill is exactly a component-level fill of bounded background
compartments, not a row-wise interpolation between individual contour pixels.

Compress the L-shaped cue to three rows and add a pink copy of the top-row foreground mask.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a two-color top row, and all
foreground pixels below the top row lie in the first column as vertical markers.

Rule
Keep the input top row as output row 0 and the first marker row as output row 1.
Output row 2 is background except at the top-row foreground columns, which are
recolored pink.

Key insight
The lower repeated marker rows only identify the vertical cue; the generated
row is a recolored mask of the horizontal cue in the top row.

Simulate particles along a path with alternating turn direction at collisions.

Input structure:
- Top-left: 2x2 monochrome blocks define a repeating color cycle (left-to-right).
- Isolated single pixels of a cycle color: start markers adjacent to the path.
- A 2x2 monochrome block of a distinct color: end marker.

Rule:
- Each start marker launches a particle moving straight, painting cycle colors in order.
- On hitting a boundary, paint that cell with the end color and turn 90°.
- Turn direction alternates: odd collisions → left (CCW), even → right (CW).
- If the scheduled turn is blocked, the particle stops.

Key insight: The alternating left/right turn rule is the core mechanism; without it the path would be trivial.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
