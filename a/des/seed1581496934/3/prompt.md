每个参考题描述包含：
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。

Move magenta particles along corridors formed by parallel colored bars.

Input structure:
- bg=7. Particles=6 in col 0. Colored bars on even rows form corridors on odd rows.

Rule:
- Particle goes straight through bg cells.
- When blocked by a colored cell, turns 90° into the perpendicular direction
  that has a bg cell flanked by same-color bars. Stops at grid edge or full blockage.

Key insight: Same-color parallel bars define the only valid corridors, so each particle follows a deterministic local trace.

Move the closest reachable maroon pixels into the 3×3 block around the unique red center.

Input structure:
- bg = orange floor, magenta walls, scattered maroon (9) pixels.
- A unique red (2) pixel marks the center of a 3×3 destination block.

Rule:
- Maroon pixels connected to the destination through floor/maroon cells (not blocked by walls) are candidates.
- Rank candidates by distance to the destination; the closest ones fill the block in row-major order.
- Moved maroons are erased (replaced with floor color).

Key insight: Wall barriers restrict connectivity — only maroon pixels reachable via flood-fill through the floor qualify, so proximity alone isn't enough.

Scale a minority cell's inner pattern up to the cell-grid level, completing a fractal overlay.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into NxN cells by separator lines of a single color.
- Most cells share an identical interior pattern (majority); a few have a distinct pattern (minority).

Rule:
- Extract the inner pixel pattern from the minority cell.
- Treat each pixel as a cell-sized stamp: active pixels → minority pattern, inactive → majority pattern.
- Position this scaled-up pattern on the cell grid so existing minority cells align with active pixels.
- Fill in all remaining active positions with the minority pattern.

Key insight: The minority cell's interior is a miniature blueprint of where minority cells should appear at the grid scale — fractal self-similarity.

<description>
Transfer sprites from red-marked lanes to green-marked lanes, recoloring and stacking.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Red (2) and green (3) thin bars define vertical lanes.
- Each lane contains repeated identical monochrome sprites in an evenly spaced vertical grid.

Rule:
- Each red lane's sprites turn grey (5); their count transfers to the nearest green lane.
- New sprites fill empty lattice slots bottom-up, using the source shape recolored to the destination lane's sprite color.
- All marker bars are removed.

Key insight: Sprite count is conserved across lanes — red sprites become grey, and equally many new sprites stack into the green lane's regular grid.

<description>
Add red outlines around objects, and mark enclosed holes inside hollow objects.

Input structure:
- A mostly uniform background contains one or more 4-connected foreground objects.
- Some objects may enclose 4-connected background holes inside their bbox.

Rule:
- For every foreground component, draw a one-cell 8-neighborhood outline in red (2).
- If a component has enclosed background holes, recolor the component to teal (8).
- Fill those enclosed holes with magenta (6) before drawing the outline.

Key insight: Holes are treated as part of the object for outlining, while only objects
that actually enclose holes get the teal/magenta interior recoloring.

<description>
Look up query glyphs in a reference table and mark whether they form a line.

Input structure:
- Teal background with two full-width pink separator rows.
- Above the first separator is a query row of 5x5 glyph cells.
- Between separators is a reference table of the same 5x5 cells; a glyph is
  identified by both its color and its 3x3 shape.

Rule:
- Green-fill the background inside every table cell whose glyph exactly
  appears in the query row.
- If the matched table cells form one complete row or one complete column,
  also green-fill the query band and the bottom verdict band.
- Otherwise leave the query band unchanged and fill the bottom verdict band red.

Key insight: The bottom color is not a count; it is the yes/no answer to
whether the queried glyphs align as a full row or column in the table.

<description>
Repaint regions from T-shaped control markers, erase the markers, and optionally rotate based on a color-9 L-marker.

Input structure:
- The grid is a mosaic of monochrome regions.
- Color 1 forms T-shaped control markers on region boundaries.
- Some controls use three singleton color-1 pixels around a colored center; that center is a literal replacement color.
- An optional 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker triggers 90-degree rotation of the output.

Rule:
- For a color-1 T marker, the single stem points at the destination region to repaint.
- The two diagonal cells behind the stem identify the source region; the destination gets that source region's original color.
- For a colored-center T marker, the same stem identifies the destination, but the center color is the replacement.
- All marker cells are filled with the final color of the source-side region.
- A 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker controls rotation: ┐ (corner top-right) → CCW 90°, ┌ (corner top-left) → CW 90°.

Key insight:
- The stem chooses what changes, while the two diagonals behind the stem choose where the marker itself belongs.

Count the two upper quadrant control regions to size an output made from the lower quadrant pattern.

Input structure:
- The grid is an even square split into four equal quadrants.
- Black is the background.
- The upper-left and upper-right quadrants are control regions.
- The lower-left quadrant is a color source tile; the lower-right quadrant is either a stencil tile or empty.

Rule:
- Output height is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-left quadrant.
- Output width is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-right quadrant.
- If the lower-right stencil has foreground pixels, tile it over the output; each stencil background pixel is filled from the lower-left quadrant cell at the corresponding coarse tile position.
- If the lower-right stencil is empty, tile the lower-left quadrant directly over the output.

Key insight:
- The top quadrants specify only dimensions, while the bottom quadrants specify a two-level repeated pattern: a fine stencil and coarse fill colors.

<description>
Extend row bars periodically across the opposite side of a separator column.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A near-solid vertical separator divides the grid into two sides.
- One side contains horizontal colored bars; the other side is blank target space.
- Bars may be stacked by row and may sit at different distances from the separator.

Rule:
- Identify the separator as the column whose non-bg cells are one color.
- Treat the denser side as the bar side and collect each contiguous row run.
- Process bars from nearest to farthest from the separator; for each bar, paint its
  color every bar-length cells into the blank side without overwriting earlier paint.

Key insight: Each bar's length is the period for its extension, and nearer bars claim target cells first.

Match sprites to frames by connected-hole count, then nest each sprite inside its frame.

Input structure:
- bg = azure (8). Large hollow squares (frames) arranged in a grid; smaller filled squares (sprites) placed elsewhere.
- Each frame and sprite has a distinct color. Sprites may contain holes (non-sprite-color pixels).

Rule:
- Frames form a regular grid; some may be bg-colored (invisible).
- Count connected hole regions inside each frame's interior and each sprite.
- Pair each frame with the sprite sharing the same hole count.
- Place the matched sprite inside the frame border; recolor sprite holes to the frame's color.

Key insight: The matching key is the number of connected hole components, not hole area or color.

Swing an irregular line segment around a nearby obstacle sprite, preserving its pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg, bar color (straight lines perpendicular to the grid edge, one end on the border), segment color (irregular stroke attached to bar's inner endpoint), obstacle color (sprite near the bar terminal).

Rule:
- Each bar is perpendicular to the edge it touches; its inner (terminal) endpoint has an attached irregular segment.
- The segment detaches and re-routes: it travels from the terminal toward the nearest obstacle, hugs the obstacle's boundary, then exits at a 45° diagonal.
- Total painted pixels equal the original segment length.

Key insight: The segment behaves like a rope swung around the obstacle — attach at the nearest point, trace the skin, exit diagonally, conserving length.

Grow four clockwise spiral wall paths from the tips of a teal cross.

Input structure:
- bg = 0 (black). A single teal (8) cross centered in the grid.

Rule:
- Each arm tip launches a "turtle" heading 90° right of its outward direction.
- Movement priority: turn right > go straight > turn left (left only if not on border).
- Normal step = 2 cells; step right after a turn = 1 cell.
- Each new cell must have a 1-cell orthogonal gap from all existing walls except the predecessor.

Key insight: The right-turn preference plus alternating 2/1 step lengths creates self-avoiding spirals that tile the grid with uniform spacing.

Fill the region enclosed by a wall sprite and radiate color outward through its opening.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall = most frequent non-bg color, forming a partial enclosure (e.g. U-shape).
- A fill-color pixel sits inside the enclosed area. Other non-bg pixels may act as obstacles.
Rule:
- Flood-fill the enclosed area with the fill color, radiating outward through the wall's open end.
- Obstacles cast "shadows" along the radiate direction, blocking fill behind them.

Key insight: The wall endpoints define the opening direction; fill radiates outward through it, and obstacles block propagation along that same axis.

Slide multi-color sprites to align their marker pixels with matching isolated border anchors.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Multi-color sprites in the interior; each has a minority-color "marker" pixel.
- Isolated border pixels (non-bg with all 4-neighbors bg) act as anchors.

Rule:
- Match each sprite to the border anchor sharing its marker color.
- Top/bottom-edge anchor (non-corner): slide sprite horizontally so marker column = anchor column.
- Left/right-edge anchor (or corner): slide sprite vertically so marker row = anchor row.

Key insight: The anchor's edge position determines the slide axis — top/bottom means horizontal, left/right (or corner) means vertical.

Dock two-tone sprites into color-matched horizontal bars with a color swap.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top area: small two-tone sprites (outer color + inner color).
- Below: horizontal bars spanning most of the row, each with a fill color and border color on edges.

Rule:
- Match each sprite to the bar whose fill color equals the sprite's outer color.
- Place the sprite at its original x-position, aligned to the bar's bottom.
- Recolor: sprite outer → bar border, sprite inner → bar fill.
- Erase original sprites from the top area.

Key insight: Color matching is inverted — the sprite's dominant color identifies its target bar, then gets swapped to the bar's accent color.

Fill partitioned regions with concentric colored bands derived from marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Grid partitioned into regions by wall-colored lines.
- Each region has a dominant base color and a few isolated marker pixels of other colors at varying depths from the region boundary.

Rule:
- For each region, read marker colors ordered by their Chebyshev distance from the boundary to build a color palette.
- If no marker sits on the boundary itself, the base color leads the palette.
- Paint every cell with palette[distance mod palette_length], producing repeating concentric rectangular frames that radiate inward.

Key insight: Each marker's depth from the boundary defines its position in the cyclic palette; the pattern then tiles inward automatically.

Move bordered 5×5 squares to their designated grid edges by border color.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Azure (8) and red (2) bordered 5×5 squares with colored interiors, scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Azure squares → left edge (col 0); red squares → right edge (col W−5).
- Each square keeps its original row.
- Process azure left-to-right, red right-to-left (nearest-to-edge first).
- If a square's rows overlap an already-placed edge square, place it one square-width inward instead.

Key insight: Near-edge-first ordering plus row-overlap determines which square sits at the edge vs. the second column.

Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by replacing singleton markers, filling short orthogonal gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
- Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
- Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all singleton pixels.
- Red singleton markers are missing line cells; yellow singleton markers are directional controls next to a line endpoint.

Rule:
- Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, preferring an endpoint supported along that same axis.
- For each line color, fill the gap between consecutive facing endpoints in a row or column.
- A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
- At crossings, yellow-control rays win; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while pure filled crossings use the lower color id.

Key insight: The singleton markers identify which sparse stroke fragments belong together; after they are colored, the intended lines are the axis-aligned gaps between facing endpoints, with yellow controls flipping one arm to the marked side.

Sort scattered 4×4 squares into two columns by type: frames left, solids right.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Multiple 4×4 objects on bg.
- Frames: colored 1px border, bg-filled 2×2 interior.
- Solids: entirely filled with one non-bg color.

Rule:
- Classify each 4×4 object as frame or solid by its interior.
- Sort each group top-to-bottom by input row.
- Stack frames in left column (cols 0–3), solids in right (cols 4–7).
- Output is 8 wide; height = 4 × max(#frames, #solids), bg-padded.

Key insight: Frame vs solid is determined solely by whether the 2×2 interior matches bg.

Reorder 5×5 blocks into a connected strip by matching edge foreground pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = background; sep = divider color (full row/column lines).
- Several 5×5 sprite blocks in a grid, separated by sep lines.

Rule:
- Two blocks "connect" when their facing edges share foreground pixels at the same offset (e.g., A's right edge ∩ B's left edge).
- Chain all blocks in the orientation (horizontal or vertical) that admits a complete sequence.
- Output is a 1×N strip of blocks in chain order, separated by sep lines.

Key insight: Edge-contact overlap determines both block ordering and output orientation.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
