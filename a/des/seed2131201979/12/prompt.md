Learn a transformation rule from a training pair of framed sprites, then apply it to a test sprite.

Input structure:
- Grid contains several colored square frames (hollow borders of a single color).
- Each frame's interior holds a small pattern sprite; one frame's interior is blank (all black).
- Two frames form a training pair (their interiors share the same color palette); one remaining frame is the test case.

Rule:
- Identify the training pair by matching interior color sets; the other non-blank frame is the test input.
- Infer the rule mapping source→destination (e.g. reflection, color inversion, gap filling, endpoint extraction, or checkerboard complement).
- Apply that same rule to the test sprite; output the transformed interior.

Key insight: The puzzle is an analogy — "A is to B as C is to ?" — where you must discover the visual rule from one example pair and generalize it.

Fill the rectangle from the lone foreground pixel to its nearest grid corner.

Input structure
- The grid is a uniform background field with exactly one foreground pixel.
- The foreground pixel's color is the color used for all added pixels.

Rule
- Find the grid corner with the smallest Manhattan distance to the foreground pixel.
- Recolor every pixel in the inclusive axis-aligned rectangle bounded by that
  corner and the foreground pixel to the foreground color.

Key insight
- The single pixel is one corner of the rectangle; the opposite corner is the
  nearest corner of the whole canvas.

Transform each 9x9 panel by mirroring across its center guide line or filling all four block slots from its lone exemplar.

Input structure
The grid is made of 9x9 panels separated by one-cell-wide grid lines. Each
panel has four monochrome 3x3 slots at the quadrant positions, with either a
full non-background center row, a full non-background center column, or no
guide line.

Rule
A panel with a full center column is reflected left-to-right, and a panel
with a full center row is reflected top-to-bottom. A panel with no guide line
has exactly one slot color that appears once and one slot color that appears
three times; recolor all four slots to the once-occurring slot color.

Key insight
The center guide line encodes the mirror axis, while panels without a guide
line are completed by copying the structurally unique slot color.

Look up query glyphs in a reference table and mark whether they form a line.

Input structure:
- Teal background with two full-width pink separator rows.
- Above the first separator is a query row of 5x5 glyph cells.
- Between separators is a reference table of the same 5x5 cells; a glyph is
  identified by both its color and its 3x3 shape.

Rule:
- Green-fill the background inside every table cell whose glyph exactly
  appears in the query row.
- If the matched table cells form one complete row or one complete column,
  also green-fill the query band and the bottom verdict band.
- Otherwise leave the query band unchanged and fill the bottom verdict band red.

Key insight: The bottom color is not a count; it is the yes/no answer to
whether the queried glyphs align as a full row or column in the table.

Compact the checkerboard's moving color toward the edge marked by the teal pixel, leaving a maroon swept trail on the marker line.

Input structure
- A blue/black checkerboard with exactly one teal marker replacing a blue pixel on a non-corner edge.
- The marker's checkerboard parity identifies the moving color (blue); the opposite parity is background (black).

Rule
- If the marker is on the left or right edge, compact moving-color pixels in every row toward that side.
- If the marker is on the top or bottom edge, compact moving-color pixels in every column toward that side.
- Preserve the teal marker at its edge cell.
- On the marker's row or column, color cells swept by shifted moving pixels maroon unless the final compacted line occupies them.

Key insight
The marker selects both the compression direction and the checkerboard color class that moves; maroon records the movement trail only along that marked line.

Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

Fill rectangles between diagonal marker pairs using a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg grid with a vertical legend at the bottom-left: each row is a (marker_color, fill_color) pair.
- Scattered L-shaped corner markers of each marker color define opposite corners of axis-aligned rectangles.
- Some markers are solid 2×2 blocks instead of corner pairs.

Rule:
- Read legend bottom-to-top; for each entry find all pixels of that marker color.
- Determine which two bbox corners carry L-shaped anchors — the *other* diagonal defines the fill region.
- Fill the diamond (all shortest-path cells between those two corners) with the legend's fill color.
- Solid 2×2 marker blocks are simply recolored to the fill color.
- Later legend entries are protected from earlier fills.

Key insight: The L-shaped anchors sit on the marker diagonal; the fill goes on the opposite diagonal of the bounding box.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Dock movable tools into border-anchored frames by filling cavities.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Border-touching components cluster into anchor frames with interior bg cavities.
- Non-border 2-color components are movable tools.

Rule:
- Match each tool to a frame whose cavity size equals one of its color-region counts.
- Rotate/flip the tool so one color fills the cavity exactly; the other stays outside.
- If the docking orientation uses a reflection, swap the tool's two colors.

Key insight: Cavity size determines tool–frame pairing; reflection triggers color swap.

Move the small colored sprite into the hollow frame by stretching its shape to the frame interior.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There are exactly two foreground colors: one forms a complete rectangular
  one-pixel-thick frame, and the other forms one 4-connected sprite outside it.
- The frame interior is initially background.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite from its outside location.
- Map the sprite bbox to the frame interior bbox, sending bbox extremes to
  interior extremes.
- Draw straight horizontal or vertical segments between mapped positions of
  adjacent sprite pixels, then fill any enclosed background region inside
  those drawn segments.

Key insight:
The outside sprite is a miniature line/fill diagram for the frame interior,
not a bitmap to scale by block replication.

Repair markers embedded in the main object and copy the remaining markers one pixel toward the solid edge.

Input structure:
- A mostly background grid contains one solid non-background edge line.
- Apart from that edge and the background, there is one large main object
  color and a smaller marker color.
- Each marker is either embedded in the main object, touching it on at
  least three 4-neighbor sides, or isolated on the background.

Rule:
- Embedded markers are recolored to the main object color.
- Isolated background markers remain in place and also paint the adjacent
  background pixel in the direction of the solid edge line.
- All other pixels are unchanged.

Key insight:
The full edge line is a direction cue: it tells which way the background
markers extend, while markers surrounded by the main object are simply
defects to be filled.

Summarize the enclosed table slots by the single object color inside each slot, using the slot background color for empty slots.

Input structure
- The most common color forms the outer background and all enclosed slot
  backgrounds.
- The enclosed background components form a complete rectangular array of
  slots, ordered by their positions.
- Each slot contains either no other color or exactly one object color.

Rule
- Find all 4-connected components of the most common color that do not touch
  the input edge.
- Sort their bounding boxes into row and column order to define the output
  table.
- For each slot, output its unique non-background color if present; otherwise
  output the background color.

Key insight
- The large grid is an expanded table: the enclosed background components are
  the cells, and any colored object drawn inside a cell is that cell's summary
  value.

Expand each colored control pixel into its corresponding fixed 4x4 glyph.

Input structure:
- Black background with single-pixel markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and/or 8.
- Some inputs also show a sample 4x4 glyph in the output color, with a same-rule marker just below-right of the sample.

Rule:
- Replace each marker color by its learned 4x4 glyph: 2->yellow frame, 3->blue ring, 5->pink diagonal blocks, 8->orange X.
- Paint each glyph with its top-left corner at the marker pixel, clipping at the grid boundary.
- Remove the sample glyphs and skip their below-right label markers.

Key insight:
- The colored pixels are control pixels for a fixed glyph alphabet; non-control sample glyphs are only legend entries, not preserved scene objects.

Erase all distractor pixels and expand the single red control pixel into the grid quadrant that contains it.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Exactly one red pixel is the control pixel.
- Other non-background pixels are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Split the grid into equal top/bottom and left/right halves.
- Fill the quadrant containing the red control pixel with red.

Key insight:
- The red control pixel selects a whole half-grid quadrant by its row half and column half; all other foreground pixels are noise.

Replace the scattered foreground markers with a bottom-left count rectangle whose two corner diagonals encode the marker counts.

Input structure
- A background grid with exactly two foreground colors used as scattered marker pixels.
- The two foreground colors have distinct pixel counts.

Rule
- Ignore marker positions and use only the two foreground counts.
- Make a 16-by-16 background canvas, fill a bottom-left red rectangle whose height is the smaller count and width is the larger count.
- Paint yellow pixels along the two rising 45-degree diagonals from the rectangle's bottom-left and bottom-right corners.

Key insight
- The marker colors and positions vary between examples; their counts alone determine the output rectangle dimensions.

Complete the scene by adding the point-reflected copy of the colored object across the central marker.

Input structure
- The grid has odd dimensions, a dominant background, and a center-row marker color appearing only at the left edge, center, and right edge.
- A single divider color fills the center column except for the center marker.
- All remaining foreground pixels form the object to copy, entirely on the left side of the divider.
Rule
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For every object pixel, paint the pixel rotated 180 degrees around the center marker with the same color.
Key insight
- The center marker is the rotation center; the yellow-looking divider is not mirrored, it only separates the source from the empty target side.

Move each right-side colored shape into the left slot whose template color is its exact complement.

Input structure:
- The grid has two equal-width slots separated by one background column.
- Non-background rows form horizontal bands separated by all-background rows.
- Each band has a shared template color in the left slot and one colored source shape in the right slot.

Rule:
- For each band, define its destination shape as the cells in the left slot not occupied by the template color.
- Normalize every right-side source shape to right-slot coordinates and match it to the unique equal destination shape.
- Clear the original right-side source pixels and paint the matched left-slot complement with the source color.

Key insight:
The right-side objects are not placed by row order; each one completes the unique left template whose missing cells have the same shape.

Move each marked L-shaped sprite onto the separate pixel matching its marker color.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground has 4-connected multicolor sprites and isolated one-pixel controls.
- Each sprite has one repeated body color in an L shape plus one embedded marker
  pixel of a different color.

Rule
- If the embedded marker color also appears as a separate isolated control pixel,
  translate the whole sprite so the body L-bend lands on that control pixel.
- Clear each moved sprite from its old position, clear its consumed control pixel,
  then paste all translated sprites; sprites without a matching control stay put.

Key insight
- The marker color pairs a sprite with its destination control, while the L-bend
  gives the orientation-independent anchor cell to place on that destination.

Stamp recolored sprites into a framed region using placeholder positions and a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg background, a rectangular single-color frame, colored placeholder cells inside the frame.
- Outside the frame: sprite shapes (one per placeholder color) and a small legend mapping each placeholder color to an output color.

Rule:
- Find the frame and its interior placeholders.
- For each placeholder color, locate the matching-color sprite outside the frame.
- Stamp each sprite at the placeholder's position inside the frame.
- Recolor every stamped sprite to the output color defined by the legend.

Key insight: The legend pairs (overlapping two-color glyphs outside the frame) dictate the final recoloring — placeholder color selects the shape, legend maps it to the output color.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
