Extrapolate the moving sprite from a horizontal sequence of shared-border frames into the next standalone frame.

Input structure
- The grid is a row of equal-width framed panels sharing their vertical border columns.
- Each panel has the same fill color and one identical interior sprite at the same local columns.
- The sprite's top row changes by a constant amount from panel to panel.

Rule
- Build one output panel with the same height, frame color, fill color, and sprite.
- Continue the sprite's diagonal motion one more panel to the right.
- Because the output is a standalone panel, advance by the full panel width, not the shared-border spacing.

Key insight
- The panels are consecutive frames of motion; the output is the next frame after the sequence.

Move colored sprites from the left strip into a framed area at marker-defined targets.

Input structure:
- bg background; rectangular frame on right with colored markers on its edges; sprites in a narrow left strip separated by a constant-color divider column.

Rule:
- For each color, target rows/cols are where both opposite frame edges share that color. Targets are the Cartesian product.
- Erase each sprite from the left and stamp it centered at every target. Higher sprites cover lower ones.

Key insight: One sprite replicates to a grid of row × column marker intersections.

Replace the scattered foreground markers with a bottom-left count rectangle whose two corner diagonals encode the marker counts.

Input structure
- A background grid with exactly two foreground colors used as scattered marker pixels.
- The two foreground colors have distinct pixel counts.

Rule
- Ignore marker positions and use only the two foreground counts.
- Make a 16-by-16 background canvas, fill a bottom-left red rectangle whose height is the smaller count and width is the larger count.
- Paint yellow pixels along the two rising 45-degree diagonals from the rectangle's bottom-left and bottom-right corners.

Key insight
- The marker colors and positions vary between examples; their counts alone determine the output rectangle dimensions.

Expand each 3-pixel L marker into a same-color corner L on an empty background.

Input structure
- The grid is an odd square with one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a monochromatic 4-connected 3-pixel L inside a
  2x2 box.

Rule
- Clear the grid to the background.
- For each marker, map its L orientation to the corresponding outer corner
  and draw that corner L in the marker color with arm length half the grid.

Key insight
- The small marker is a miniature corner; its orientation, not its position,
  chooses which outer corner receives the expanded L.

Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

Flatten the interior object into a centered line and move the guide bars inward to bracket it.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- One non-background guide color touches the boundary and forms exactly two full parallel bars plus a split perpendicular center bar.
- The other non-background color is a single 8-connected interior object whose area determines the flattened line length.

Rule:
- If the guide pair is vertical, make a vertical object-colored line centered between those bars; otherwise use the analogous horizontal line.
- The line length equals the number of interior object pixels and is centered on the split perpendicular guide bar.
- Rebuild the guide color as the perpendicular center bar plus two full bars immediately beside the flattened object line.

Key insight:
- The guide bars supply only the orientation and center; the interior object's pixel count supplies the length of the final one-cell-thick line.

Recolor the row-wise passage indicated by wall pixels with the singleton marker color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one singleton marker pixel and one wall color.
- Wall pixels lie on several rows and form left/right limits around the marker column.
- Empty rows between the top and bottom wall rows are open horizontal passages.

Rule:
- On a wall row, paint background pixels between the nearest wall strictly
  left of the marker column and the nearest wall at or right of it; if only
  one side is present, paint from that wall to the opposite grid edge.
- On empty rows between the top and bottom wall rows, paint the whole row.
- On empty rows outside the wall-row band, reuse the nearest end wall-row interval.
- Preserve wall pixels and the original marker pixel.

Key insight:
- The wall color defines scanline limits relative to the marker column; the
  marker color fills those implied horizontal spans rather than flood-filling
  through connected background.

Recolor each side-marked multicolor object embedded in a monochrome panel to its marker color.

Input structure:
- Same-color 4-connected components form monochrome panel regions.
- The bounding box of a panel may contain 4-connected non-panel-color objects.
- A target object touches exactly one side of its panel bbox, and all of its
  pixels on that side have one marker color.

Rule:
- For every target object, fill any panel-colored holes enclosed by the object.
- Recolor the object and filled holes to the side marker color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- A multicolor object's single contact side identifies both which object should
  be normalized and which color should replace it.

Count same-color patterns per frame and represent the tally as dots inside.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Hollow rectangular frames in various colors.
- Small monochrome pattern sprites scattered outside frames.

Rule:
- Remove all small patterns from the grid.
- For each frame of color C, count how many patterns share color C.
- Draw that many dots along the frame's center row, spaced by 2, starting from the right.

Key insight: Frames act as tally displays — scattered same-color patterns are "absorbed" and their count is shown as interior dots.

Decode the colored slot map inside the marked motif and rebuild the motif lattice with those colors.

Input structure:
- A blank background surrounds a rectangular lattice of identical motifs.
- The motif rows and columns are separated by one background line.
- One motif has colored marker pixels in its internal odd-row/odd-column slots.

Rule:
- The motif size is 2R+1 by 2C+1, where R by C is the motif lattice size.
- Read the marked motif's odd internal slots as the color map for the R by C output motifs.
- Slots that still contain the repeated motif color map to that repeated motif color.
- Rebuild the compact lattice on a canvas filled with the repeated motif color,
  painting each motif mask with its decoded color.

Key insight:
- The holes and filled odd slots inside one motif are a miniature legend for recoloring the entire repeated motif lattice.

Copy colored control-ray ports from one rectangular sprite orientation to every matching transformed sprite.

Input structure:
- bg is the most common color.
- Several dense 2-by-N or N-by-2 rectangular sprites are dihedral transforms of one template.
- Isolated single-pixel control markers sit on rays projected outward from the dominant long edge of some sprites.

Rule:
- For each sprite, the active edge is the long side whose cells have the strongest same-color majority.
- A control marker seen first along an outward ray from an active-edge cell assigns its color to that template cell.
- On every transformed sprite, draw that assigned color outward from the corresponding active-edge cell through bg cells until blocked or out of bounds.

Key insight:
- The marker positions are not absolute; they label cells of a shared rectangular template, then the labels follow each sprite's rotation/reflection.

Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

Fold each straight red rod at its black marker, leaving the gray-anchored side fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground object is a straight horizontal or vertical 4-connected rod.
- Each rod contains many pixels of one line color, one endpoint marker, and one
  interior control marker.

Rule:
- For every rod, keep the segment from the endpoint marker through the control
  marker unchanged.
- Move the line-color tail on the far side of the control marker to a
  perpendicular ray starting next to that marker.
- Choose the perpendicular direction with more space to the grid edge.

Key insight:
- The endpoint marker identifies the fixed side of the rod, while the control
  marker is the hinge; the tail folds into the larger open half-plane.

Add red outlines around objects, and mark enclosed holes inside hollow objects.

Input structure:
- A mostly uniform background contains one or more 4-connected foreground objects.
- Some objects may enclose 4-connected background holes inside their bbox.

Rule:
- For every foreground component, draw a one-cell 8-neighborhood outline in red (2).
- If a component has enclosed background holes, recolor the component to teal (8).
- Fill those enclosed holes with magenta (6) before drawing the outline.

Key insight: Holes are treated as part of the object for outlining, while only objects
that actually enclose holes get the teal/magenta interior recoloring.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Shift each row's dominant middle-color run left until its right edge aligns with the leftmost original right edge, moving displaced left-side pixels after the run.

Input structure:
- The grid has three colors.
- The most common color forms one contiguous horizontal run in every row.
- Pixels before those runs share one side color, and pixels after those runs share the other side color.

Rule:
- Find the minimum right edge column among the middle-color runs.
- In each row, keep the run width and the trailing right-side color count.
- Place the middle-color run so its right edge is at that minimum column, unless the run is too wide, in which case start it at column 0.
- Fill any remaining non-trailing cells with the left-side color.

Key insight:
The varying row prefixes are movable padding; the stable feature is the leftmost right boundary of the middle-color shape.

Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Move the closest reachable maroon pixels into the 3×3 block around the unique red center.

Input structure:
- bg = orange floor, magenta walls, scattered maroon (9) pixels.
- A unique red (2) pixel marks the center of a 3×3 destination block.

Rule:
- Maroon pixels connected to the destination through floor/maroon cells (not blocked by walls) are candidates.
- Rank candidates by distance to the destination; the closest ones fill the block in row-major order.
- Moved maroons are erased (replaced with floor color).

Key insight: Wall barriers restrict connectivity — only maroon pixels reachable via flood-fill through the floor qualify, so proximity alone isn't enough.

Shift each interior pixel whose color matches a frame side one cell toward that matching side.

Input structure
The grid has a one-cell-thick rectangular frame: the four corners are the
background color, and each side between corners is a solid, distinct side
color. The interior is mostly background with sparse foreground pixels.

Rule
Interior pixels with the top-side color move one row up, bottom-side color
move one row down, left-side color move one column left, and right-side color
move one column right. A pixel already adjacent to its matching side stays in
place; colors that do not match a frame side and the frame itself are unchanged.

Key insight
The colored frame sides act as direction labels for matching interior pixels.

Fill hollow sprites' interiors using a color-palette legend on the grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Several hollow sprites with distinct border colors.
- A small 2×N or N×2 palette block sits on one grid edge; one row/column lists border colors, the other lists corresponding fill colors.

Rule:
- Locate the palette legend on a grid edge and read it as a border→fill color mapping.
- Find enclosed bg regions (holes) inside sprites that don't touch the grid boundary.
- For each hole, identify the most common adjacent border color, look it up in the palette, and fill the hole with the mapped fill color.

Key insight: The palette's edge position and orientation determine reading direction; border colors in the palette uniquely key into fill colors.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
