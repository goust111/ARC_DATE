Emit four teal beams from a square, turning at colored obstacles per a legend.

Input structure:
- Top band: grey (5) legend with colored vertical bars in cells; bar position (left or right) encodes turn direction.
- Below: main grid with bg, a solid teal (8) square, and colored obstacle blocks.

Rule:
- Remove the legend from the output.
- From the teal square, shoot a beam in each cardinal direction (as a sliding copy of the square).
- Each beam paints teal over bg cells as it moves.
- On hitting an obstacle of color C, consult the legend: bar on left → turn counterclockwise, bar on right → turn clockwise. Continue in the new direction.
- Beams stop at grid edges.

Key insight: The legend's bar position (left vs right within its cell) is the encoding for turn direction at each obstacle color.

Drop every large foreground object straight down to the bottom while leaving small marker objects fixed.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color and exactly one foreground color.
- The foreground is split into separated 4-connected objects.
- Objects of area at most three are stationary markers; larger objects are moving sprites.

Rule:
- Clear each moving sprite from its original position.
- Translate each moving sprite vertically downward until its bbox bottom reaches the grid bottom.
- Repaint each translated sprite in its original color; small markers stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- Object area separates the active falling sprites from the small fixed markers, and all active sprites follow the same vertical path.

Move the yellow 3x3 frame by the displacement encoded by the gray path, then draw its diagonal yellow corner rays.

Input structure:
- The background is black.
- One 3x3 yellow frame has a non-yellow control-color center.
- A second control-color pixel is connected through gray path pixels to a lone yellow endpoint.

Rule:
- Use the vector from the second control-color pixel to the lone yellow endpoint as the frame's translation.
- Fill the whole output with the control color.
- Draw the translated yellow frame and extend yellow diagonal rays outward from its four corners to the grid edge.

Key insight: The gray path's turns are irrelevant; its two colored endpoints encode the net displacement to apply to the frame.

Fill partitioned regions with concentric colored bands derived from marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Grid partitioned into regions by wall-colored lines.
- Each region has a dominant base color and a few isolated marker pixels of other colors at varying depths from the region boundary.

Rule:
- For each region, read marker colors ordered by their Chebyshev distance from the boundary to build a color palette.
- If no marker sits on the boundary itself, the base color leads the palette.
- Paint every cell with palette[distance mod palette_length], producing repeating concentric rectangular frames that radiate inward.

Key insight: Each marker's depth from the boundary defines its position in the cyclic palette; the pattern then tiles inward automatically.

Crop the largest object and overlay each smaller sprite where its shared marker pattern matches.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color, and the foreground has one largest destination object plus smaller source sprites.
- Each source sprite shares exactly one marker color with the destination object.

Rule
- Output the tight bbox crop of the largest object.
- Translate each source sprite so every connected marker component of the shared color exactly matches destination marker components.
- Paste source sprites in decreasing area order, so smaller sprites can sit on top of larger ones when they overlap.

Key insight
- The shared-color marker components are alignment keys; matching whole marker components distinguishes singleton slots from larger same-color marker blocks.

Transform each 9x9 panel by mirroring across its center guide line or filling all four block slots from its lone exemplar.

Input structure
The grid is made of 9x9 panels separated by one-cell-wide grid lines. Each
panel has four monochrome 3x3 slots at the quadrant positions, with either a
full non-background center row, a full non-background center column, or no
guide line.

Rule
A panel with a full center column is reflected left-to-right, and a panel
with a full center row is reflected top-to-bottom. A panel with no guide line
has exactly one slot color that appears once and one slot color that appears
three times; recolor all four slots to the once-occurring slot color.

Key insight
The center guide line encodes the mirror axis, while panels without a guide
line are completed by copying the structurally unique slot color.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Cut a sprite along border-control rays and slide pieces to grid corners.

Input structure:
- bg, fg (main object, ~centered), ctrl (1-2 pixels on grid edges).

Rule:
- Draw rays inward from each ctrl pixel along its row/col, painting only bg cells up to the farthest fg pixel (intermittent).
- Rays partition the grid; fg on the cut line stays in place.
- Cut pieces in regions touching a control edge slide to that corner; others vanish.

Key insight: Only regions sharing a border edge with a control pixel keep their piece; the ray skips fg cells.

Emit diagonal beams from framed 2x2 blocks through frame gaps; beams interact on collision.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall color (e.g. green) forms 4x4 frames around 2x2 monochrome blocks.
- Each frame has one or more gap pixels where the wall is missing.

Rule:
- Each gap emits a beam of the inner block's color, traveling diagonally outward (direction set by gap position relative to the block).
- Beams paint every cell they cross until they hit the grid edge or collide.
- 90° collision: both beams turn 45° toward their bisector direction; the intersection cell is left blank (1-pixel gap).
- 45° collision: beams merge into a zigzag (alternating cardinal + diagonal steps) with no gap at the meeting point.

Key insight: Two distinct collision rules — 90° produces a gap and single-pixel diagonal lines; 45° produces no gap and thicker zigzag bands.

Recover the repeating background pattern hidden under the largest solid rectangle.

Input structure:
- The grid is covered by a small row/column periodic pattern.
- Several non-pattern colors form solid rectangular foreground objects that
  overwrite the pattern.
- The requested output region is the largest of those solid rectangles.

Rule:
- Find every 4-connected monochromatic object whose bounding box is a filled
  rectangle with both dimensions greater than one.
- Treat those rectangles as masks, infer the smallest repeating tile that is
  consistent with all remaining visible pixels, and repaint the largest
  rectangle's coordinates with that tile.

Key insight: The rectangle colors are occluders; the visible pixels outside
them are enough to reconstruct the original periodic background underneath.

Complete a visible crop into the shared 20x20 binary motif in its matching orientation.

Input structure:
- The grid is a two-color rectangular crop of one rotation/reflection of the same 20x20 motif.
- One color is the motif foreground and the other color is the motif background.

Rule:
- Try each input color as the foreground mask.
- Match that mask against every possible window in every dihedral orientation of the motif.
- Repaint the uniquely matched full 20x20 motif with the matched foreground/background colors.

Key insight:
- The examples are partial windows of one canonical binary pattern; the local crop is distinctive enough to identify the full orientation and offset.

Complete each partially hidden simple foreground shape by recoloring the occluding pixels in its footprint.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several solid foreground shapes.
- Some shapes are partially hidden by other foreground colors, but their full
  footprint is still indicated by a foreground-filled bbox or by a foreground-
  filled 45-degree diagonal line.

Rule
- For each foreground color, complete its full rectangular bbox when that bbox
  contains no background and includes other colors.
- Otherwise, complete its 45-degree diagonal line when all visible pixels lie
  on that line and the hidden line cells are foreground, not background.
- Recolor only those hidden footprint pixels; leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The occluded cells are exactly the non-background cells inside a simple
  shape's implied footprint, so completing shapes is a local recoloring problem.

Slide each blue/teal or yellow/orange row pair together while preserving its left-to-right order.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background.
- Each nonempty row contains exactly two distinct foreground pixels.
- Blue/teal and yellow/orange row pairs are the moving pairs; other color pairs are distractors.

Rule
- For each moving pair, keep the left pixel fixed and move the right pixel left until it touches the left pixel.
- Clear the moved pixel's original location, and leave non-moving rows unchanged.

Key insight
- Only same-hue-family pixel pairs attract horizontally; separated unrelated colors do not compact.

Recolor the small defect bars on each shared-color object with the opposite panel color.

Input structure
- The grid contains two large panel colors and one shared object color.
- Each shared-color object is a mostly solid rectangle inside exactly one panel.
Rule
- Find the near-solid rectangular core of each object.
- Missing core pixels and one-cell protrusions define two-pixel bars perpendicular to the nearest core edge.
- Recolor those bars with the other panel color; leave all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The colors to add are not tied to numeric ids: each object's surrounding panel identifies the opposite panel color.

Stagger the two horizontal input regions onto a larger maroon separator canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a rectangular grid with an even number of rows.
- The top half and bottom half are the two regions to preserve.
- Maroon is absent from the input and is used only as the new separator color.

Rule:
- Create an output with one extra row and one extra column, filled with maroon.
- Copy the top half into the upper-left corner.
- Copy the bottom half one row below the top region and one column to the right.

Key insight:
The output is not a recoloring of either region; it inserts an L-shaped maroon
gap by diagonally offsetting the lower half from the upper half.

Move each teal-cornered filled rectangle one cell diagonally toward its teal corner.

Input structure:
- Dominant background surrounds several filled rectangular colored objects.
- Each object has exactly one teal control pixel replacing one corner cell of
  its rectangle.

Rule:
- Treat the teal pixel as the missing corner of its colored rectangle.
- Erase each original rectangle footprint, including the teal pixel.
- Repaint the completed rectangle shifted one cell diagonally in the direction
  of that teal corner.

Key insight:
- The control pixel's corner position gives both the missing cell to restore
  and the diagonal motion vector.

Move each gray bar into its adjacent orange rectangle as full stripes from the contacted edge.

Input structure
- The scene uses black outside space, yellow fill, gray one-cell-thick bars, and solid orange rectangles.
- Each gray bar 4-touches exactly one orange rectangle; some orange rectangles have no touching gray bar.
- Gray bars touching the same orange rectangle all have the same orientation.

Rule
- Recolor every original gray cell to yellow.
- For each orange rectangle touched by gray bars, count the gray cells assigned to that rectangle.
- Horizontal gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange rows starting from the contacted top or bottom row.
- Vertical gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange columns starting from the contacted left or right column.
- Orange rectangles with no touching gray bar remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The gray pixels are not copied by shape; their count is transferred into the neighboring orange rectangle as edge-aligned row or column stripes.

Redraw foreground objects as nested square rings ordered by object size.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a 4-connected monochromatic component.
- Foreground object areas are distinct.

Rule:
- Sort the foreground objects by decreasing pixel count.
- Create a square output with side length 2 * number_of_objects - 1.
- The largest object color fills the outer ring, each next object color fills
  the next inner ring, and the smallest object color fills the center pixel.

Key insight: The objects' original shapes do not get copied; their areas
determine only the outside-to-inside order of the nested square pattern.

Expand the sparse dot lattice into a 26x26 drawing with thick bars between adjacent matching dots.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground pixels lie on logical rows and columns separated by background spacer rows/columns.
- A logical row or column is present when it contains at least one foreground pixel.

Rule
- Expand every background spacer row/column to thickness 2.
- Expand the logical rows/columns equally so the full output is 26x26.
- Paint each foreground logical pixel as a solid rectangle of its color.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels horizontally through the intervening spacer.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels vertically only when neither endpoint is part of a horizontal same-color run.

Key insight
- The input is a sampled line drawing: horizontal same-color runs define the bars first, and only unclaimed same-color vertical neighbors are joined.

Rotate each vertical bar's color one slot right and its height one slot left.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds several monochrome one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Every bar is bottom-aligned and occupies a distinct column.
- The ordered bar slots are read from left to right.

Rule
- Keep the grid shape and the bar columns unchanged.
- At slot i, use the color from the previous slot cyclically.
- At slot i, use the height from the next slot cyclically.

Key insight
- Color and height are independent cyclic attributes of the ordered bar slots:
  colors rotate right while heights rotate left.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
