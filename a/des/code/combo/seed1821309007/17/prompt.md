Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Red diamond outlines contract by one layer and gray diamond outlines expand by one layer while other objects stay fixed.

Input structure
- A 16x16 orange-background grid contains one-cell-thick Manhattan-diamond outlines.
- Red and gray outlines are the changing objects; other colored diamond outlines are static.
- Some outlines may be clipped by the grid boundary, but their visible pixels still fit a clipped Manhattan-distance contour.
Rule
- Clear all red and gray pixels.
- Red objects are redrawn with the same diamond center and radius minus one.
- Gray objects are redrawn with radius plus one; an ambiguous edge-clipped growing arc continues away from the nearest perpendicular edge.
Key insight
- The task is not about moving whole objects: each changing object is a contour of a diamond, and the visible operation is one step of contour contraction or expansion.

Invert each row's native foreground color against the black background.

Input structure
- A black-background grid whose rows each have one native foreground color plus optional distractor colors.
- The native row color is the most frequent non-bg color in that row; if tied, its run starts leftmost among tied colors.

Rule
- For each row independently, turn pixels of the native row color into bg.
- Turn every other pixel in that row, including bg and distractor colors, into the native row color.

Key insight
- Distractor colors are not preserved objects; they mark cells that participate in the binary complement of the row's native color.

Fill enclosed regions along a line seeded by unique border pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Colored lines/drawings on the grid.
- Unique single-pixel colors on the grid border mark seed endpoints of each line.

Rule:
- Each border seed pixel connects (8-connected) to a line drawing.
- Find closed bg cavities whose boundary touches that line.
- Flood-fill each such cavity with the seed pixel's color.

Key insight: Only cavities reachable through the seed's own line get filled; the seed's unique color acts as a per-line fill label.

Build the woven rectangle determined by the two marked cells on each crossed bar.

Input structure
A black-background grid contains one long horizontal bar and one long vertical bar.
Each bar has a dominant base color and exactly two same-colored marker pixels.

Rule
The horizontal marker pair gives the output column span.  From the horizontal bar
row, walk toward the farther vertical marker; rows and columns alternate every
other cell.  Even step/even offset cells use the horizontal marker color until
the nearer vertical marker is reached, then use the vertical marker color.
Odd row steps use the horizontal base on marker columns and the original
crossing color on spacer columns.  Spacer columns on even row steps use the
vertical base, except at the switch row where they use the crossing color.

Key insight
The original cross cell records which base color wins at base/base lattice
crossings; the nearer vertical marker is the color-switch boundary.

Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by replacing singleton markers, filling short orthogonal gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
- Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
- Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all singleton pixels.
- Red singleton markers are missing line cells; yellow singleton markers are directional controls next to a line endpoint.

Rule:
- Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, preferring an endpoint supported along that same axis.
- For each line color, fill the gap between consecutive facing endpoints in a row or column.
- A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
- At crossings, yellow-control rays win; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while pure filled crossings use the lower color id.

Key insight: The singleton markers identify which sparse stroke fragments belong together; after they are colored, the intended lines are the axis-aligned gaps between facing endpoints, with yellow controls flipping one arm to the marked side.

Move each right-side colored shape into the left slot whose template color is its exact complement.

Input structure:
- The grid has two equal-width slots separated by one background column.
- Non-background rows form horizontal bands separated by all-background rows.
- Each band has a shared template color in the left slot and one colored source shape in the right slot.

Rule:
- For each band, define its destination shape as the cells in the left slot not occupied by the template color.
- Normalize every right-side source shape to right-slot coordinates and match it to the unique equal destination shape.
- Clear the original right-side source pixels and paint the matched left-slot complement with the source color.

Key insight:
The right-side objects are not placed by row order; each one completes the unique left template whose missing cells have the same shape.

Extract the single plain rectangle and redraw it with the aligned rectangles' border-relative marker pattern.

Input structure:
- The boundary color is the background/separator.
- Foreground objects are dense rectangular regions; exactly one rectangle has only its base color.
- Other rectangles contain their base color plus marker pixels.

Rule:
- Crop the only plain rectangle; this crop is the output canvas.
- Use marked rectangles whose row span overlaps the plain rectangle's row span.
- Transfer their marker pixels by preserving each marker run's distance from the nearest rectangle edges.

Key insight:
- The marked rectangles are examples of an edge-relative pattern, so the missing plain rectangle receives the same pattern resized to its own dimensions.

Drop the singleton marker into the matching red U-shaped container, or make a bottom-row puddle if no closed container is hit.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one singleton marker pixel on the top row,
  and one other foreground color forming vertical bars and bottom segments.
- A closed container is a U shape: two vertical side bars with a continuous
  bottom segment between them and an empty rectangular interior above the bottom.

Rule
- Remove the top marker from its original cell.
- If exactly one closed U-shaped container has the marker column within its
  horizontal footprint, fill that container's empty interior with the marker color.
- If no closed container is under the marker column, fill the whole bottom row
  with the marker color.

Key insight
- The marker does not identify a color by value; it identifies a vertical drop
  column, and only a structurally closed U shape can catch and contain the fill.

Extract the top-left or top-right 2x2 corner crop selected by the top edge clue.

Input structure
- The input is a square color grid whose answer is one of the two 2x2 crops
  touching the top edge and a grid corner.
- A repeated color on the top row, when present, acts as the primary side cue.
- Otherwise, the two top corner colors have different whole-grid frequencies.

Rule
- If a top-row color repeats, find the repeated top-row occurrence nearest to
  a left or right edge and take the 2x2 top-corner crop on that side.
- If the top row has no repeated color, compare the whole-grid frequencies of
  the two top-corner colors and take the side whose corner color is rarer.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for an arbitrary 2x2 search: the decisive information
  is on the top edge, and it selects which top corner crop to keep.

Transform each 9x9 panel by mirroring across its center guide line or filling all four block slots from its lone exemplar.

Input structure
The grid is made of 9x9 panels separated by one-cell-wide grid lines. Each
panel has four monochrome 3x3 slots at the quadrant positions, with either a
full non-background center row, a full non-background center column, or no
guide line.

Rule
A panel with a full center column is reflected left-to-right, and a panel
with a full center row is reflected top-to-bottom. A panel with no guide line
has exactly one slot color that appears once and one slot color that appears
three times; recolor all four slots to the once-occurring slot color.

Key insight
The center guide line encodes the mirror axis, while panels without a guide
line are completed by copying the structurally unique slot color.

Copy the unique colored sprite tile into every tiled cell marked by an internal separator-colored pixel.

Input structure
- Full same-color separator rows and columns partition the grid into equal rectangular tiles.
- One tile contains the only non-background, non-separator colored sprite.
- Target tiles are otherwise background-colored but contain at least one internal pixel of the separator color.

Rule
- Keep the separator lines and the source sprite tile unchanged.
- Replace each marked target tile with an exact copy of the source tile.
- Unmarked background-only tiles remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The internal separator-colored pixels are placement markers; the single colored tile is the template to stamp into those marked cells.

Cycle each solid odd-sided square to the next smaller centered square, wrapping a single pixel to a 9x9 square.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a separated 4-connected monochrome solid square.
- Square side lengths are odd and belong to the cycle 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- Keep each square's color and center.
- Replace side length n by n - 2 when n > 1; replace side length 1 by side length 9.

Key insight:
- The visible operation is on square size, not color: side lengths cycle 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Recolor vertical bars by legend-driven rank selection.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Top-left: monochrome blocks touching row 0; each has color K and height k.
- Main grid: vertical bars capped top and bottom by a single color, with solid-color interiors.

Rule:
- For each legend entry (K, k), find vertical bars capped by K.
- Rank bars by interior length (longest = rank 1).
- Recolor the rank-k bar's interior to K.

Key insight: Legend height is a rank index into length-sorted bars, not a literal size.

Move the repeated boundary color's rectangles one block inward while leaving singleton boundary rectangles in place.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Foreground objects are solid monochrome rectangles touching a grid corner.
- Exactly one foreground color appears as multiple separate 4-connected objects; other colors appear once.

Rule:
- Clear the multiple objects of the repeated color from their original positions.
- For each cleared rectangle, translate it away from the row and column border it touches by exactly its height and width.
- Keep singleton-color objects unchanged; overlapping translated rectangles of the same color merge.

Key insight:
- Multiplicity selects the moving color, and each boundary rectangle's touched edges determine its inward diagonal translation.

Detect thin '+' shapes in a single foreground color and recolor them to teal.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One foreground color (e.g. yellow) forms various shapes on the bg, some of which are small '+' crosses.

Rule:
- A '+' center is any foreground pixel whose 4 orthogonal neighbors are also foreground.
- Recolor each such center and its 4 neighbors to teal (8).
- All other pixels remain unchanged.

Key insight: Only compact 5-cell crosses qualify — a pixel embedded in a larger filled region also satisfies the neighbor check, so the rule highlights every local '+' motif, not just isolated ones.

Rotate the colors around every 3x3 foreground ring, with corners and side-centers cycling in opposite directions.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Each 4-connected foreground object is a complete 3x3 ring: eight foreground pixels around a background center.

Rule
- For each ring, move corner colors one step around the four corners.
- Move side-center colors one step around the four side centers in the opposite direction.
- Leave the background center and all other background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Corners and side centers form two separate four-cycles on the same 3x3 ring.

Grow an alternating pink/orange triangular trace downward from the horizontal orange seed row.

Input structure:
- The grid has a green background and one horizontal row containing all orange foreground pixels.
- The seed row may contain isolated orange pixels and adjacent orange runs.
- Pink is absent from the input and is used for the first generated row.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- Two rows below the current active row, place a child pixel between each active pair
  whose middle cell in the current row is background.
- Alternate generated row colors between pink and orange, stopping when no children
  can be generated or the next row would leave the grid.

Key insight:
- Only an active-background-active triplet in the current row reproduces; contiguous
  active runs do not produce children through occupied middle cells.

Move the lower sprite and its pink guide into the upper panel, aligning the sprite to the guide's lower-left branch.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one full-width separator row.
- Below the separator are exactly two foreground roles: a five-pixel guide marker and one monochrome sprite.
- The guide marker has normalized shape {(0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1)} and starts immediately below the separator.

Rule
- Clear the canvas to the background, preserving the separator row.
- Translate the guide marker upward so its top row becomes row 0.
- Move the sprite, preserving its color and shape, so the sprite bbox bottom-right aligns to the translated guide's lower-left branch.

Key insight
- The marker supplies the destination anchor: its lower-left branch cell is where the moved sprite's bbox bottom-right must land.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
