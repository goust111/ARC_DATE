Replicate a pre-drawn corner pattern to every other marker-bearing corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most frequent color. Hollow 0-frames (possibly partial L-shapes); each
  frame-corner cell is either 0 or a painted (non-bg, non-0) color.
- >= 1 'source' corner: the pattern is already drawn (one color, both outward
  cells and an inward-diagonal trail).
- Other corners: a single colored pixel on the inward diagonal at the pattern's
  deepest (k,k) offset; the pixel's color is that corner's target color.

Rule:
- Extract the canonical (TL-oriented) pattern from any source.
- For each non-source corner whose marker cell is colored, paint the same
  pattern rotated to that corner's orientation, using the marker's color.

Key insight: the pattern is symmetric about the corner's inward-diagonal axis
(canonical dr == dc), so it reflects cleanly across all four corner orientations.
Painting uses each target's OWN marker color, not the source color.

Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Combine each column's repeated template mask with its single solid color swatch.

Input structure:
- The grid is a table of framed panels separated by background rows/columns.
- The leftmost column gives one solid row-label color for each panel row.
- In each panel column, exactly one panel has a solid non-background interior,
  while the other panels share the same mask drawn in one template color on
  the background.

Rule:
- For every panel column, find the row containing the solid interior swatch.
- Rebuild one output panel using that row's left label as the frame color.
- Fill the repeated template mask with the swatch color and leave the mask
  background cells as background; separate rebuilt panels with one
  background column.

Key insight:
The table encodes a colorized stencil per column: the solid panel supplies
the paint color and frame label, while the duplicate template panels supply
the shape mask.

Repaint regions from T-shaped control markers, erase the markers, and optionally rotate based on a color-9 L-marker.

Input structure:
- The grid is a mosaic of monochrome regions.
- Color 1 forms T-shaped control markers on region boundaries.
- Some controls use three singleton color-1 pixels around a colored center; that center is a literal replacement color.
- An optional 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker triggers 90-degree rotation of the output.

Rule:
- For a color-1 T marker, the single stem points at the destination region to repaint.
- The two diagonal cells behind the stem identify the source region; the destination gets that source region's original color.
- For a colored-center T marker, the same stem identifies the destination, but the center color is the replacement.
- All marker cells are filled with the final color of the source-side region.
- A 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker controls rotation: ┐ (corner top-right) → CCW 90°, ┌ (corner top-left) → CW 90°.

Key insight:
- The stem chooses what changes, while the two diagonals behind the stem choose where the marker itself belongs.

Reconstruct the repeated tile from its separated copies and mark the missing pixels in the damaged copy blue.

Input structure:
- The input is a lattice of equal-size blocks separated by one-cell solid rows
  and columns of the same separator color.
- All blocks are copies of one motif except exactly one block, where some
  motif pixels have been overwritten by the motif background color.
- Blue is absent from the input and is reserved as the output marker color.

Rule:
- Recover the motif by taking the unique majority color at each local block
  coordinate across all block copies.
- Find the single block that differs from this consensus motif.
- Return the consensus motif, recoloring the differing local coordinates blue.

Key insight:
- The repeated copies provide redundancy: the damaged positions are exactly
  the coordinates where the lone nonconforming copy has background instead of
  the consensus motif color.

Compress the stacked colored bars into a compact ordered table with the control pixel on the selected row.

Input structure
- A background grid contains several full-width colored bars from top to
  bottom; the last bar is the base/separator color.
- Each non-base bar may have an aligned three-column comb motif below it,
  alternating side-pair rows with solid rows.
- A singleton control pixel sits away from the colored motifs.

Rule
- Make one output row per non-base bar, preserving top-to-bottom order.
- In that row, paint the bar color once for each solid three-pixel row in
  its motif, then paint the base-bar color in the separator column.
- The singleton control pixel sits immediately above the base bar. Among
  motifs whose open side-pair parity is compatible with that bottom row,
  put the control pixel in the output row with the fewest solid rows; use
  horizontal distance to the motif center only to break count ties.

Key insight
- The vertical comb height is a count, while the control pixel is read by
  projecting it onto the center gap of compatible comb rows rather than by
  its vertical band alone.

Transform each 9x9 panel by mirroring across its center guide line or filling all four block slots from its lone exemplar.

Input structure
The grid is made of 9x9 panels separated by one-cell-wide grid lines. Each
panel has four monochrome 3x3 slots at the quadrant positions, with either a
full non-background center row, a full non-background center column, or no
guide line.

Rule
A panel with a full center column is reflected left-to-right, and a panel
with a full center row is reflected top-to-bottom. A panel with no guide line
has exactly one slot color that appears once and one slot color that appears
three times; recolor all four slots to the once-occurring slot color.

Key insight
The center guide line encodes the mirror axis, while panels without a guide
line are completed by copying the structurally unique slot color.

Replace gray plus-shaped damage masks with the hidden colors of the rectilinear mosaic.

Input structure:
- Color 8 appears only as isolated 3x3 plus masks.
- The non-mask pixels are visible parts of a clean grid made from horizontal
  and vertical color regions.

Rule:
- Treat every color-8 pixel as unknown damage and leave all other pixels fixed.
- First copy unknown pixels from exact matching parallel rows or columns.
- Then fill any remaining mask cells from opposite-side continuations and the
  better-supported local straight edge.

Key insight:
- The gray pluses are occluders, not objects; the underlying colors are
  determined by repeated line templates and nearby axis-aligned boundaries.

Extend each solid foreground rectangle toward its same-color isolated pixels with capped one-cell paths, clearing each original marker pixel.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground color has exactly one solid rectangular object and one or more isolated same-color marker pixels.
- Every marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the rectangle bbox and lies outside it.
Rule
- For each marker, draw a one-cell-wide straight path from the adjacent side of the rectangle through one cell beyond the marker.
- Add a three-pixel perpendicular cap at the rectangle end and around the marker endpoint.
- Recolor the original marker pixel to background.
Key insight
- The isolated pixels are not copied; they mark the hollow endpoints of capped protrusions grown from their matching rectangle.

Cycle each solid odd-sided square to the next smaller centered square, wrapping a single pixel to a 9x9 square.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a separated 4-connected monochrome solid square.
- Square side lengths are odd and belong to the cycle 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- Keep each square's color and center.
- Replace side length n by n - 2 when n > 1; replace side length 1 by side length 9.

Key insight:
- The visible operation is on square size, not color: side lengths cycle 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.

Transfer each colored marker to its adjacent neutral mask component, then erase the markers.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color.
- The neutral mask color is the unique most frequent foreground color.
- Other foreground colors are marker pixels that may touch neutral 4-connected mask components.
Rule
- Remove every marker pixel by recoloring it to the background.
- For each 4-connected neutral mask component, find marker colors touching it by edge adjacency.
- If a component touches one marker color, recolor the whole neutral component to that marker color.
- If a component touches no marker color, leave it neutral.
Key insight
- Marker pixels label neighboring neutral regions but are not part of the final colored objects.

Thicken the sparse frame and stamp the external sparse sprites into it in positional order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a regular lattice color, one large
sparse rectangular frame, and one or more external monochrome sprites whose
pixels also sit on a two-step lattice.

Rule
Use the largest sparse rectangular perimeter as the frame. Clear that frame
region and the external sprite pixels to background, draw a solid one-pixel
border in the frame color, solidify each sparse sprite into its contiguous
two-step mask, and place the sprites inside the frame with equal gaps.
Wide frames receive sprites left-to-right by source position; tall frames
receive them top-to-bottom by source position.

Key insight
The frame supplies ordered slots: the sprite-to-slot assignment is by visible
source order, not by numeric color or by matching individual cells.

Convert each colored partitioned frame into a horizontal bar whose length is its number of enclosed regions.

Input structure:
- Black background with several axis-aligned colored line drawings.
- The line drawings are damaged by scattered pixels of one non-background noise color and by overlaps with other drawings.
- Each real drawing is a rectangular partitioned frame enclosing one or more background regions.

Rule:
- For each non-background color, reconstruct its horizontal and vertical wall segments from dense row/column evidence.
- Count the 4-connected background regions fully enclosed by those reconstructed walls.
- The color with no enclosed region is the noise/pad color.
- Sort drawing colors by enclosed-region count; equal counts are ordered by which reconstructed frame covers the other.

Key insight:
- The scattered color is not an object; it only pads the histogram, while each true object's room count is stable after rectilinear wall reconstruction.

Recolor each framed interior mask with the color from the next red frame clockwise around the blue connector cycle.

Input structure
- The grid contains hollow red square frames connected pairwise by blue line components.
- The blue components connect the frames into one cycle, with every frame touching exactly two blue components.
- Each frame interior contains background plus exactly one non-background color mask.

Rule
- Sort the red frames clockwise by their centers around the cycle.
- Keep each frame's interior mask shape in place, but recolor it with the interior color from the next clockwise frame.
- Leave the red frames, blue connectors, background, and interior background holes unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored masks do not move; the blue cycle gives the order in which their colors rotate.

Connect two sprites using matching connector pixels, then tight-crop.

Input structure:
- Background color `bg`, sprite color `obj`, connector color `ctrl` (small, 2 components).
- Two main foreground sprites, plus possibly tiny detached pixels belonging to one sprite.

Rule:
- Identify the **base** sprite (closest to grid top-left).
- Translate the other sprite so its connector sits one cell above the base's connector.
- Stamp the plug onto the base; remove connectors (recolor `ctrl` to `obj`).
- Output is the tight crop around all non-background pixels.

Key insight: The connector pixels define the unique docking point and direction.

Eject content pixels from cup-shaped frames outward along each cup's tail direction.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Hollow cup/Y/funnel frames, each a unique border color.
- Each cup has a convergent tail spike on one side and an open mouth on the opposite side.
- Content pixels (a single non-border color per cup) sit inside the cup's mouth interior.

Rule:
- For each cup, identify its tail spike and tail direction.
- Erase all content pixels from the mouth interior.
- Draw a straight line of content-colored pixels from the spike outward in the tail direction,
  one pixel per erased content pixel; cells beyond the grid edge are dropped.

Key insight: The tail spike is the unique convergent point whose outward direction is opposite
the mouth opening where the content lives.

Swap the upper two-pixel segment and the lower two-pixel segment around the fixed center pixel.

Input structure:
- The grid is a 5x1 vertical column of individual colored pixels.
- The middle pixel is a separator between two same-size two-pixel segments.

Rule:
- Keep the middle pixel in place.
- Reverse the order of the two pixels above the middle.
- Reverse the order of the two pixels below the middle.

Key insight:
- The transformation is local vertical order reversal on each side of the center, not a color-specific rule.

Invert each row's native foreground color against the black background.

Input structure
- A black-background grid whose rows each have one native foreground color plus optional distractor colors.
- The native row color is the most frequent non-bg color in that row; if tied, its run starts leftmost among tied colors.

Rule
- For each row independently, turn pixels of the native row color into bg.
- Turn every other pixel in that row, including bg and distractor colors, into the native row color.

Key insight
- Distractor colors are not preserved objects; they mark cells that participate in the binary complement of the row's native color.

Paint an inner border around the region reachable from a corner marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; wall color (blue) forms barriers dividing the grid.
- A unique single pixel (magenta) sits on one corner — the start marker.
- Some wall-colored pixels are structural (border-touching, enclosing regions); others are decorations.

Rule:
- Flood-fill from the marker corner to find all reachable bg cells, blocked by structural walls.
- Erase wall-colored decorations hidden behind structural walls (not reachable from marker side).
- Paint orange (color 7) on every reachable bg cell adjacent to a wall or grid edge — forming a 1-cell inner border.

Key insight: Only border-connected wall components act as real barriers; interior wall fragments are decorations to be removed.

Delete connected components whose colors match a legend swatch.

Input structure:
- Background (bg) fills most of the grid.
- Top-left corner: a small square legend region bordered on its bottom and right edges by a single color; the interior holds a set of "target" colors.
- Elsewhere: multicolored objects (4-connected components) on the bg.

Rule:
- Read the target color set from inside the legend border.
- For each connected component, check whether it contains **all** target colors.
- Erase (fill with bg) every component that does; leave all others unchanged.
- Output grid is the same size.

Key insight: The legend acts as a filter specification — only components carrying the full color palette shown in the legend are removed.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
