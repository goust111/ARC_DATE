Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Decode the colored 3x3 contour motif into a 16x16 periodic lattice with the motif stamped in maroon at the center.

Input structure:
- The grid is 6x6 with orange background and one non-orange color.
- The non-orange pixels have a tight 3x3 bbox containing one contour glyph.
- The glyph is one of the task's period-3 contour forms: plus, H, X, or four corners.

Rule:
- Decode the 3x3 glyph into the period-3 orange phase tile.
- Fill a black 16x16 canvas by repeating that orange phase tile.
- Tile the original 3x3 glyph 2x2 and recolor its true pixels to maroon in the centered 6x6 region.

Key insight:
- The colored object is not copied at its input location; it is a small contour code whose phase tells where orange appears in the repeated lattice.

Move the source-color pixels into the unique outline interior whose size matches the source count.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color forms 8-connected outline objects with row-wise interior cells.
- The other foreground color supplies a set of source pixels away from the chosen outline.
Rule
- For each possible outline color, compute each 8-connected outline object's
  row-span interior: background pixels strictly between the leftmost and
  rightmost outline pixels on each occupied row.
- Select the unique outline interior whose cell count equals the total
  number of pixels of the other foreground color.
- Erase the source pixels and paint that matched interior with the source color.
Key insight
- The colors are roles, not fixed IDs: the source color is identified by
  counting, and the destination is the outline with a matching interior area.

Simulate water falling from top-edge sources, pooling on shelves, and cascading off edges.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; water = rarest non-bg; shelf = other non-bg.
- Sources: water clusters touching top row. Shelves: horizontal segments.

Rule:
- Water falls down from sources, painting bg cells as water.
- On hitting a shelf, it spreads across the shelf span plus one cell past each end.
- From those overflow positions, water resumes falling independently.

Key insight: Each shelf splits a stream into two at its edges, creating a branching waterfall tree.

Move bordered 5×5 squares to their designated grid edges by border color.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Azure (8) and red (2) bordered 5×5 squares with colored interiors, scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Azure squares → left edge (col 0); red squares → right edge (col W−5).
- Each square keeps its original row.
- Process azure left-to-right, red right-to-left (nearest-to-edge first).
- If a square's rows overlap an already-placed edge square, place it one square-width inward instead.

Key insight: Near-edge-first ordering plus row-overlap determines which square sits at the edge vs. the second column.

Grow an alternating pink/orange triangular trace downward from the horizontal orange seed row.

Input structure:
- The grid has a green background and one horizontal row containing all orange foreground pixels.
- The seed row may contain isolated orange pixels and adjacent orange runs.
- Pink is absent from the input and is used for the first generated row.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- Two rows below the current active row, place a child pixel between each active pair
  whose middle cell in the current row is background.
- Alternate generated row colors between pink and orange, stopping when no children
  can be generated or the next row would leave the grid.

Key insight:
- Only an active-background-active triplet in the current row reproduces; contiguous
  active runs do not produce children through occupied middle cells.

Replace a corner L with a same-color right-triangle outline in the corresponding corner of an enlarged canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a square grid with one background color and one foreground color.
- The foreground is a one-pixel-thick L inside a square bbox.
- The L touches exactly one horizontal grid edge and one vertical grid edge, identifying a corner.

Rule:
- Fill a square output canvas of side 3n-2, where n is the input side length, with the background color.
- Double the L leg length to get the triangle side length.
- Draw the two perpendicular triangle legs on the same output corner edges and connect their free endpoints with the diagonal.

Key insight:
- The input L encodes the corner, color, and side length of the triangle outline; the missing side is the diagonal between the L's two free endpoints.

Use the pink control pixel to choose where the maroon pixel belongs inside the grey 3x3 region, and turn the control pixel maroon.

Input structure:
- The grid contains one 3x3 region made from eight grey pixels and one maroon pixel.
- There is exactly one pink control pixel outside that region.

Rule:
- Restore the old maroon cell in the 3x3 region to grey.
- Compare the pink pixel to the 3x3 region: above/same band/below selects top/middle/bottom, and left/same band/right selects left/middle/right.
- Paint the selected cell maroon and recolor the pink control pixel maroon.

Key insight:
- The pink pixel acts as a relative-position marker for a 3x3 target inside the grey region.

Slide a solid square through a winding channel to reach a same-sized target square.

Input structure:
- bg (most common color). A river color forms a winding corridor.
- Two same-sized NxN solid squares on the river: mover and destination, each a distinct color.

Rule:
- The mover square travels along the river toward the destination.
- It can only pass through positions where the full NxN area is river.
- If reachable, the mover replaces the destination; otherwise it stops at the farthest reachable point.
- The mover's original position is filled with the river color.

Key insight: Chokepoints narrower than N pixels block the square, forcing it to stop short.

Assemble scattered rectangular pieces into a rectangle at an L-marker corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg rectangular pieces scattered on the grid.
- 3-pixel L-marker (2x2 minus one cell) tags the corner; the gap is the corner cell.

Rule:
- rect_col = most common color across all piece pixels; all outer rectangle edges must be rect_col.
- Translate pieces (no rotation) to tile the rectangle; touching edges must match, with rect_col as wildcard.

Key insight: rect_col acts as wildcard during edge matching — only non-rect_col pixels at shared boundaries must agree.

Extend diagonal rays outward from outer-border segments adjacent to diamond shapes on a checkerboard.

Input structure:
- Checkerboard bg (two most common colors).
- Hollow diamond outlines (8-pixel) in a non-bg color (inner border).
- Short diagonal line segments in another non-bg color adjacent to each diamond edge (outer border).

Rule:
- For each outer-border segment, determine the outward direction (perpendicular to the segment, away from the diamond).
- From each endpoint of the segment, cast a diagonal ray outward, painting over bg pixels with the segment's color until hitting a non-bg pixel or the grid edge.

Key insight: Rays emit only from the two endpoints of each outer-border segment, not every pixel, and travel diagonally away from the diamond.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Swap each 5x5 sprite with its corner marker color and stamp same-marker composite masks into the matching corner.

Input structure:
- A 30x30 grid has one dominant background color.
- Non-background corner pixels are marker labels.
- Every other foreground color is the body of one 5x5 sprite containing exactly one pixel of a corner marker color.

Rule:
- For each sprite, recolor body pixels to the sprite marker color and recolor the marker pixel back to its body color.
- If a marker lies on the side facing its matching corner and another same-marker sprite has a body pixel at that same local cell, use that visible body color for the marker pixel.
- For each corner marker, overlay the masks of all sprites with that marker color into the corner 5x5 block and paint the visible composite with the marker color.

Key insight:
The corner pixels are labels that group 5x5 sprites by their embedded marker color; each labeled corner shows the grouped sprite silhouette.

Erase the complete interior glyph and expand each endpoint marker pair into its color's full glyph.

Input structure
- The grid is 20x20 with background inside two same-color full-height vertical frame bars.
- Inside the frame there is one complete color glyph and one or more other colors appearing only as two endpoint markers in the same row.
- Marker endpoints are always in the first and last interior columns.

Rule
- Keep the vertical frame unchanged.
- Erase any complete interior glyph.
- For each endpoint marker pair, use that marker color's learned glyph template and anchor its horizontal bar on the marker row.

Key insight
- Color identifies which glyph shape to draw; the two endpoint pixels are not copied objects, they are anchors for reconstructing that color's full symbol.

Recover each partially hidden 6x6 ring sprite and stack complete copies from top layer to bottom layer.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Several non-background colors are visible fragments of the same 12-pixel
  outline ring in a 6x6 box; small off-template marker pixels are noise.
- Ring fragments overlap, so upper rings replace some expected pixels of
  lower rings, and a ring may also be clipped by the input boundary.

Rule:
- Identify every substantial color whose pixels all lie on one translated
  copy of the ring template.
- For each missing in-bounds template pixel, the color currently occupying
  that pixel is above the hidden ring.
- Topologically sort these occlusion relations from top to bottom, then draw
  one complete 6x6 ring for each color in that order on a background canvas.

Key insight:
- The output is not a crop of the scene; it is the layer stack of complete
  ring sprites reconstructed from their visible fragments.

Crop off the control row and column, then cyclically roll the payload by the two marker offsets.

Input structure
- The grid is square, with a control row on top and a control column on the left.
- The control row and column share one filler color and one single-pixel marker color.
- The lower-right square is the payload and contains none of the control colors.

Rule
- Remove the top control row and left control column.
- Roll the remaining payload down by the marker's zero-based position in the left control column.
- Roll the payload right by the marker's zero-based position in the top control row.

Key insight
- The two border markers are cyclic shift amounts for the payload, not colors to preserve.

Move each marked L-shaped sprite onto the separate pixel matching its marker color.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground has 4-connected multicolor sprites and isolated one-pixel controls.
- Each sprite has one repeated body color in an L shape plus one embedded marker
  pixel of a different color.

Rule
- If the embedded marker color also appears as a separate isolated control pixel,
  translate the whole sprite so the body L-bend lands on that control pixel.
- Clear each moved sprite from its old position, clear its consumed control pixel,
  then paste all translated sprites; sprites without a matching control stay put.

Key insight
- The marker color pairs a sprite with its destination control, while the L-bend
  gives the orientation-independent anchor cell to place on that destination.

Extend each top-row control pixel downward as a vertical toggle ray in its own color.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Non-background pixels on the top row are control pixels, each identifying
  one column and one ray color.
- Foreground regions below may intersect these control columns.

Rule:
- For every top-row control pixel, process the cells below it in the same
  column down to the bottom edge.
- A cell that already has the control color is erased to the background.
- Every other cell on that downward ray is painted with the control color.
- The top-row control pixels themselves remain unchanged.

Key insight:
The top row is a set of vertical ray launchers; each ray toggles only cells
matching its own color and overwrites all other colors along that column.

Fill the small background compartments bounded by the long contour color.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and two foreground colors.
- The more frequent foreground color forms long 8-connected contour fragments.
- The other foreground color is a fixed distractor/obstacle color that partitions
  the background but is never recolored.

Rule:
- Split the background into 4-connected regions using all foreground pixels as
  barriers.
- Keep the two largest background regions as the outside of the contour drawing.
- Recolor every other background region that touches a long contour component
  to the contour color; leave all foreground pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The apparent area fill is exactly a component-level fill of bounded background
compartments, not a row-wise interpolation between individual contour pixels.

Slide black shapes rightward to a grey separator, then shoot red rays from enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- A vertical grey (5) separator column divides the grid into left and right halves.
- Black shapes sit on the left side against a background color (bg).

Rule:
- Translate each black connected component rightward until its right edge is flush with the separator.
- After sliding, find enclosed bg regions (holes) within the black shapes that touch the column just left of the separator.
- For each row spanned by such a hole, emit a red ray across the entire right half of the grid.

Key insight: Only holes adjacent to the separator trigger rays — the sliding creates enclosures that act as "nozzles" projecting rightward.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
