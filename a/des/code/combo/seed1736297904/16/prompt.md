Sort objects to top or bottom edge by whether their shape (up to rotation/flip) is shared.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several multicolor connected components (8-connected) scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Compute each object's canonical shape (binary mask, invariant to rotation and flip).
- Objects whose shape appears in two or more components → translate to TOP edge (row 0).
- Objects whose shape is unique → translate to BOTTOM edge (row H−h).
- Horizontal position (left column) is preserved; only vertical translation changes.

Key insight: The sorting criterion is shape frequency (rotation-invariant), not area — duplicated shapes go up, unique shapes go down.

Fill each black 5x5 region's missing interior positions with a fixed 3x3 positional color legend.

Input structure
- The grid uses teal as the dominant background and black for one or more
  5x5 regions.
- Each black region has a black one-pixel border and a 3x3 interior that
  may already contain teal pixels.

Rule
- Overlay the legend 1 7 6 / 4 8 5 / 2 9 3 on the 3x3 interior of every
  5x5 black region.
- Wherever an interior non-center legend position is still black, recolor it
  to the corresponding legend color; leave existing teal pixels, the center,
  and the black border unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored output pixels are not derived from the teal motif shape; they
  are the fixed position labels for the missing cells of each 3x3 interior.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

Connect same-colored foreground components with one-cell-wide orthogonal paths around teal wall segments.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Teal cells are fixed wall segments and are never source connectors.
- Other foreground colors appear as one or more 4-connected components; colors with a single component stay unchanged.

Rule
- For each non-background, non-teal color, read its 4-connected components in row-major order.
- Connect each consecutive pair by the shortest clear L-shaped path between the two components.
- Clear paths may pass only through background or the same color, and they preserve the previous travel axis when both bends are possible.

Key insight
- The output is not a global recolor: each color traces a routed chain through its own components while teal cells and other colors act as blockers.

Build a four-quadrant rotational tiling of the input square.

Input structure
- The input is a square grid treated as one complete sprite.

Rule
- Each output quadrant is a 2x2 repetition of a rotated copy of the whole input.
- The quadrant rotations are upper-left 180 degrees, upper-right 90 degrees
  clockwise, lower-left 90 degrees counterclockwise, and lower-right unchanged.

Key insight
- The output is a 4x4 grid of original-size blocks, not a per-pixel scale-up.

Extract the hidden two-color image by compacting the rows and columns of its complete mask.

Input structure
The grid contains one pair of colors whose pixels occupy every cell in the
cross product of their active rows and active columns; all other colors form
the surrounding filler or separators.
Rule
Find that unique color pair, keep exactly the rows and columns touched by
the pair, and return the induced subgrid.
Key insight
The target image is not chosen by color id; it is the only two-color mask
whose occupied pixels form a full rectangular row/column product after
deleting unused rows and columns.

Predict the next panel in a framed sequence by continuing each scheduled colored interval.

Input structure
- The grid is made from three or more equal panels in one row or one column.
- The final input panel is the static target template; every earlier panel differs from it only by dynamic colors absent from the template.
- Each dynamic color appears in a regular temporal schedule across the earlier panels.

Rule
- Keep the final template panel as the output canvas.
- For every dynamic color whose schedule reaches the next panel, compare its last two appearances.
- Extrapolate each one-dimensional interval along the color's changing row or column axis and paint that predicted mask.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for the last visible panel, but for the next frame after the blank/template slot.

Move the left-edge fragment into its same-colored anchor fragment to complete a solid rectangle.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Exactly one foreground color is split into two 4-connected objects: one
  touches the left edge, and the other is an anchor away from the left edge.
- The translated left-edge object and the anchor can form one filled rectangle.
Rule
- Find the unique split color whose left-edge object can be translated onto
  background cells beside the other same-colored object so their union is a
  solid axis-aligned rectangle.
- Clear the left-edge object's original cells to the background.
- Paint that object at the unique completing offset, preserving all other cells.
Key insight
- The active color is identified by object structure and rectangle completion,
  not by a fixed color id; the same-colored anchor object stays in place.

Complete each boundary tab or notch by adding the complementary feature on the opposite side of the foreground object.

Input structure
- The grid has exactly two colors: a dominant background and one foreground object.
- The foreground object is a thick rectilinear shape with one-pixel tabs and notches on its boundary.

Rule
- A foreground tab is a one-neighbor boundary pixel; project through its full row or column span and remove the opposite edge pixel to make a matching notch.
- A background notch is a one-pixel cut with three foreground 4-neighbors; project across the full row or column span and add a tab just outside the opposite edge.
- Notches immediately beside a tab source are not independent sources, because that gap belongs to the tab's local boundary shape.

Key insight
- The changed pixels are not color-specific noise; they are paired jigsaw-like boundary features on opposite sides of the same thick row or column cross-section.

Draw a blue folded corner-to-corner route through the lone marker's column.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid filled with one background color.
- Exactly one non-background marker pixel; blue is absent from the input.

Rule:
- Preserve the marker and repaint background pixels in its column blue from top to bottom.
- If the marker is in the unique center column, connect that column to the top-right and bottom-left corners.
- Otherwise, connect the column to the top-left and bottom-right corners.

Key insight:
The marker's column is the route spine; its central vs off-center placement selects which opposite corner pair gets the horizontal edge segments.

Look up query glyphs in a reference table and mark whether they form a line.

Input structure:
- Teal background with two full-width pink separator rows.
- Above the first separator is a query row of 5x5 glyph cells.
- Between separators is a reference table of the same 5x5 cells; a glyph is
  identified by both its color and its 3x3 shape.

Rule:
- Green-fill the background inside every table cell whose glyph exactly
  appears in the query row.
- If the matched table cells form one complete row or one complete column,
  also green-fill the query band and the bottom verdict band.
- Otherwise leave the query band unchanged and fill the bottom verdict band red.

Key insight: The bottom color is not a count; it is the yes/no answer to
whether the queried glyphs align as a full row or column in the table.

Scale a minority cell's inner pattern up to the cell-grid level, completing a fractal overlay.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into NxN cells by separator lines of a single color.
- Most cells share an identical interior pattern (majority); a few have a distinct pattern (minority).

Rule:
- Extract the inner pixel pattern from the minority cell.
- Treat each pixel as a cell-sized stamp: active pixels → minority pattern, inactive → majority pattern.
- Position this scaled-up pattern on the cell grid so existing minority cells align with active pixels.
- Fill in all remaining active positions with the minority pattern.

Key insight: The minority cell's interior is a miniature blueprint of where minority cells should appear at the grid scale — fractal self-similarity.

Complete a four-corner framed rectangle from one decorated anchor rectangle and its diagonal mate.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Two same-color solid rectangular anchors of the same size sit on opposite
  diagonal corners, with the first anchor above-left of the second.
- The upper-left anchor has two one-cell-thick vertical control bars to its
  right and two one-cell-thick horizontal control bars below it.

Rule:
- Copy the anchor rectangle into the two missing corners of the implied
  larger rectangle.
- Repeat the right-side control bars horizontally between the left and right
  anchors, using their spacing as the period, and draw the outer top and
  bottom borders in the first right-control color.
- Repeat the below-side control bars vertically between the top and bottom
  anchors, using the same period, and draw the outer left and right borders
  in the first below-control color.

Key insight: The small control bars are the first two ticks of two periodic
frame patterns; the diagonal anchor supplies the opposite corner and the
missing two anchor copies.

Assemble colored sprites into a central bar's notches, chaining successive pieces along fixed-width strips.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Largest monochrome component is a solid "bar" with boundary notches (bg holes opening to its bbox edge).
- Several smaller colored sprites scattered around the bar.

Rule:
- Each bar notch is filled by a root piece whose shape exactly covers the hole.
- The root defines a strip (column-span or row-span) for its chain.
- Successive pieces fill the bg cells inside the previous piece's bbox, locked to the same strip width.
- Multiple chains grow independently from different bar notches.

Key insight: The root piece's extent perpendicular to the chain direction locks the strip width for all subsequent pieces in that chain.

Mark the shallowest and deepest columns of a solid terrain boundary with vertical colored guide lines.

Input structure:
- The first row is a solid empty separator.
- Below it, each column consists of upper fill cells followed by a contiguous suffix of terrain cells.
- The bottom row is all terrain, so every column has a well-defined first terrain row.

Rule:
- Find the column whose first terrain row is latest; it is unique and its upper fill run becomes maroon.
- Find the rightmost column whose first terrain row is earliest; its upper fill run becomes yellow.
- Preserve the empty separator, terrain cells, and all other upper fill cells.

Key insight:
- The task is a column-height summary of the terrain profile: color the deepest upper run and the highest terrain peak.

Count the two upper quadrant control regions to size an output made from the lower quadrant pattern.

Input structure:
- The grid is an even square split into four equal quadrants.
- Black is the background.
- The upper-left and upper-right quadrants are control regions.
- The lower-left quadrant is a color source tile; the lower-right quadrant is either a stencil tile or empty.

Rule:
- Output height is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-left quadrant.
- Output width is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-right quadrant.
- If the lower-right stencil has foreground pixels, tile it over the output; each stencil background pixel is filled from the lower-left quadrant cell at the corresponding coarse tile position.
- If the lower-right stencil is empty, tile the lower-left quadrant directly over the output.

Key insight:
- The top quadrants specify only dimensions, while the bottom quadrants specify a two-level repeated pattern: a fine stencil and coarse fill colors.

Repeat each 3x3 control-center sprite toward the matching solid rectangle until a copy first overlaps that rectangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each sprite is a 3x3 foreground object whose eight border pixels have one color and whose center has a different control color.
- For every control color, there is exactly one separate solid rectangular object of that color.

Rule
- Match each sprite to the unique solid rectangle whose color equals the sprite center.
- Copy the whole 3x3 sprite in the cardinal direction of that rectangle, stepping by three cells each time.
- Stop after pasting the first copy whose 3x3 bbox overlaps the rectangle; copied pixels overwrite the rectangle there.

Key insight
The center pixel is not the paint color: it is a destination key, while the entire 3x3 sprite is the motif tiled along the straight path.

Transmit colored tokens along wire networks, converting each to its complementary 3×3 pattern.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Non-bg cells form wire networks and 3×3 tokens (solid blocks or X/diagonal patterns) near wire endpoints.

Rule:
- Every solid 3×3 token is replaced in-place by a diamond (center + 4 cardinal neighbors).
- Each token near a wire endpoint sends its complement to the opposite endpoint: solid emits X, X emits diamond.

Key insight: Token shape cycles solid → X → diamond; wires route each complement to the far end.

Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

Transfer center colors between bordered sprites matched by color, keeping only path-connected ones.

Input structure:
- bg, grey (5) path network, and several small "bordered sprites" each having a border color and a single center pixel of a different color.
- Grey path forms a one-stroke trail under 8-connectivity; its start/end cells touch exactly two destination sprites via ports.

Rule:
- Destination sprites are determined by the grey trail's two endpoints.
- For each destination, find the source sprite whose border color equals the destination's center color.
- Replace the destination's center pixel with the source's center color.
- Delete all non-destination sprites; grey paths and destinations remain.

Key insight: Center color of each destination acts as a lookup key into the border colors of other sprites, enabling indirect color transfer.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
