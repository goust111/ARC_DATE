Fill the background under a top-row red/grey span with a shrinking diagonal pattern that alternates red and grey.

Input structure:
- The grid has an orange background.
- All foreground pixels are red or grey and lie on the top row.
- The first and last top-row foreground pixels define an odd-width span.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- For row r below the top, fill columns span_left + r through span_right - r.
- Each filled cell takes the top-row color r columns up-left, flipped red<->grey once per row step.

Key insight:
- The output is the top-row span propagated down-right along diagonals, while the allowable region shrinks inward from both ends each row.

Erase the top palette row and redraw it below as a widening wedge centered on its missing cell.

Input structure
- The top row is a palette row with exactly one background gap.
- Below it, the only foreground is one vertical marker bar of a single color.
- The marker bar is either in the gap column or immediately beside it.

Rule
- Clear the grid to background.
- Starting at the top of the marker bar, each next row copies one more
  column of the top-row palette on both sides of the gap.
- Fill the gap column with the marker color, and keep the vertical marker bar.

Key insight
- The lone background cell in the top row is the center of the expanding
  copy; the lower vertical bar provides the center color and the row where
  the expansion begins.

Push the central solid rectangle to the grid edge, splitting the perpendicular target rectangle around its path.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- There are exactly three monochrome foreground objects arranged on one
  horizontal or vertical axis.
- The middle object on that axis is a solid rectangular moving object.
- One end object is a solid rectangle or bar whose long side is perpendicular
  to the movement axis; this is the target to split.

Rule
- Move the middle rectangle along the axis toward the target until it is
  flush with the grid edge in that direction.
- Clear the original middle rectangle and the original target.
- Split the target through the moving rectangle's two-cell-wide path and
  shift the two halves one cell outward perpendicular to the movement.
- Keep the other end object unchanged.

Key insight
- The non-target end object acts as a pusher; the central rectangle travels
  away from it through the perpendicular target, opening a matching gap.

Reverse the sequence of colors along the single 4-connected foreground path while keeping the path shape fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- All non-background pixels form one multicolor 4-connected one-pixel-wide path.
- The path has exactly two endpoints and no branches.

Rule:
- Walk the path from one endpoint to the other.
- Replace the colors on those same path cells by the original path colors in reverse order.
- Leave every background pixel unchanged.

Key insight:
- Nothing moves geometrically; only the color string written on the path is reversed between the endpoints.

Look up query glyphs in a reference table and mark whether they form a line.

Input structure:
- Teal background with two full-width pink separator rows.
- Above the first separator is a query row of 5x5 glyph cells.
- Between separators is a reference table of the same 5x5 cells; a glyph is
  identified by both its color and its 3x3 shape.

Rule:
- Green-fill the background inside every table cell whose glyph exactly
  appears in the query row.
- If the matched table cells form one complete row or one complete column,
  also green-fill the query band and the bottom verdict band.
- Otherwise leave the query band unchanged and fill the bottom verdict band red.

Key insight: The bottom color is not a count; it is the yes/no answer to
whether the queried glyphs align as a full row or column in the table.

Cycle each solid odd-sided square to the next smaller centered square, wrapping a single pixel to a 9x9 square.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a separated 4-connected monochrome solid square.
- Square side lengths are odd and belong to the cycle 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- Keep each square's color and center.
- Replace side length n by n - 2 when n > 1; replace side length 1 by side length 9.

Key insight:
- The visible operation is on square size, not color: side lengths cycle 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.

Paint the teal outline of the right triangle determined by the missing corner of the grey-marker square.

Input structure
The grid is an orange background with exactly four foreground marker pixels of one color. The markers have a square bounding box: three markers are bbox corners, and the fourth marker is inside that square.
Rule
Find the one corner of the marker bounding square that has no marker. That missing corner is the right-angle vertex of a right isosceles triangle; paint its two axis-aligned legs and the opposite diagonal in teal, leaving existing marker pixels unchanged.
Key insight
The present corner marker opposite the missing corner is a decoy; the three triangle vertices are the missing corner and the two marker corners adjacent to it.

Straighten a colored snake path into a single-column strip preserving pixel order.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Non-bg pixels form a single 4-connected path (snake) with exactly two endpoints.
- Each path pixel may be a different non-bg color.

Rule:
- Find the two endpoints (cells with only one path neighbor) of the snake.
- Begin at the top-left-most endpoint and trace the path cell by cell.
- Output an (N×1) column listing each cell's color in traversal order.

Key insight: The path is a simple chain with no branches; choosing the top-left-most endpoint fixes a unique reading direction.

Complete a four-corner framed rectangle from one decorated anchor rectangle and its diagonal mate.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Two same-color solid rectangular anchors of the same size sit on opposite
  diagonal corners, with the first anchor above-left of the second.
- The upper-left anchor has two one-cell-thick vertical control bars to its
  right and two one-cell-thick horizontal control bars below it.

Rule:
- Copy the anchor rectangle into the two missing corners of the implied
  larger rectangle.
- Repeat the right-side control bars horizontally between the left and right
  anchors, using their spacing as the period, and draw the outer top and
  bottom borders in the first right-control color.
- Repeat the below-side control bars vertically between the top and bottom
  anchors, using the same period, and draw the outer left and right borders
  in the first below-control color.

Key insight: The small control bars are the first two ticks of two periodic
frame patterns; the diagonal anchor supplies the opposite corner and the
missing two anchor copies.

Recover each partially hidden 6x6 ring sprite and stack complete copies from top layer to bottom layer.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Several non-background colors are visible fragments of the same 12-pixel
  outline ring in a 6x6 box; small off-template marker pixels are noise.
- Ring fragments overlap, so upper rings replace some expected pixels of
  lower rings, and a ring may also be clipped by the input boundary.

Rule:
- Identify every substantial color whose pixels all lie on one translated
  copy of the ring template.
- For each missing in-bounds template pixel, the color currently occupying
  that pixel is above the hidden ring.
- Topologically sort these occlusion relations from top to bottom, then draw
  one complete 6x6 ring for each color in that order on a background canvas.

Key insight:
- The output is not a crop of the scene; it is the layer stack of complete
  ring sprites reconstructed from their visible fragments.

Drop the blue sprites downward relative to the red divider, with vertical sprites passing through to the bottom.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a single full-width horizontal divider row.
- The other non-background color forms 4-connected sprites above the divider.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite pixels.
- A one-column sprite falls to the bottom of its column and deletes the divider
  pixel it crossed.
- Any wider sprite falls until its unique widest horizontal row is immediately
  above the divider row; if the moved sprite overlaps the divider, it covers it.

Key insight:
The red row is not a generic floor: only one-column sprites pass through to the
bottom, while wider sprites are registered by their widest horizontal segment.

Mark the center of each odd-sized solid square with the plus marker color, erasing the marker only when it is outside the marked-center field.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: one unique 3x3 plus marker and one color forming separated solid square objects.

Rule:
- For every non-marker 4-connected object, assert it is a solid square.
- If the square side length is odd, recolor its center pixel to the plus marker color; even-sided squares stay unchanged.
- Preserve the plus marker when its center lies inside the bounding box of the odd-square centers; otherwise erase it to background.

Key insight:
- Odd-sided solid squares have a single visible center pixel, and the plus supplies the color used to identify those centers.

Simulate tokens falling through a pipe network after gates rotate open.

Input structure:
- Wall (0), bg (pipe fill), gate (horizontal 1×3 bars), token (small edge pixels).

Rule:
- Rotate each gate into a vertical blocker; gate cells become bg.
- Tokens drop downward through bg, choosing the extreme column for their side (left→min, right→max).
- Tokens settle at true pipe ends (adjacent to wall/boundary), packing inward.

Key insight: Tokens select drop columns by entry side and land at wall-bounded endpoints, ignoring blocker-bounded ones.

Drop the columns of the top marker downward, stopping blue-ended columns on grey obstacles and letting maroon-ended columns pass to the bottom.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The most numerous non-background color forms stationary grey obstacle pixels.
- The other two colors form a single 3x3 top-edge marker whose top two rows
  are maroon and whose bottom row contains maroon or blue control pixels.

Rule
- Erase the top marker.
- Treat each marker column as a vertical drop retaining its three colors.
- A column whose bottom control pixel is blue stops immediately above the
  first grey pixel below that column, or bottom-aligns if none exists.
- Contiguous maroon-ended columns pass through obstacles and bottom-align;
  if such a run has a clear down-right slide from a grey ledge, shift the
  run one column right before bottom-aligning.
- When a maroon-ended drop lands through a grey bar on the bottom edge, clear
  the rest of the marker-width gap in that bottom bar.

Key insight
- The bottom row of the top marker is a control strip: blue cells mean
  "stick to the first obstacle," while maroon cells mean "fall through."

Remove each fracture marker line and push the surrounding object pixels one cell away from it.

Input structure
- A background grid with 8-connected foreground objects made from a body color and a rarer marker color.
- Each object has a non-square bbox; the marker pixels form one complete fracture line across the shorter bbox axis.

Rule
- Erase all marker pixels.
- For a wide object, each row has one marker; body pixels left of it shift one cell left and body pixels right of it shift one cell right.
- For a tall object, each column has one marker; body pixels above it shift one cell up and body pixels below it shift one cell down.

Key insight
- The marker line is a crack through the object, so the two sides separate by one pixel perpendicular to the crack.

Extrapolate the moving sprite from a horizontal sequence of shared-border frames into the next standalone frame.

Input structure
- The grid is a row of equal-width framed panels sharing their vertical border columns.
- Each panel has the same fill color and one identical interior sprite at the same local columns.
- The sprite's top row changes by a constant amount from panel to panel.

Rule
- Build one output panel with the same height, frame color, fill color, and sprite.
- Continue the sprite's diagonal motion one more panel to the right.
- Because the output is a standalone panel, advance by the full panel width, not the shared-border spacing.

Key insight
- The panels are consecutive frames of motion; the output is the next frame after the sequence.

Stamp translated copies of a monochrome template guided by a singleton pixel layout.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A large monochrome shape (template, color T).
- Singleton pixels elsewhere: exactly one is color T (layout origin); the rest share color O (overlap color).
- Singletons sit on a uniform-spacing lattice.

Rule:
- Convert each singleton's offset from the origin into coarse lattice units.
- Place a template copy at each offset, scaled by template height/width.
- The origin's copy is painted O instead of T.
- Any pixel covered by two or more copies is also recolored to O.

Key insight: The single T-colored singleton identifies both the origin position and the "self" copy, which is uniquely recolored.

Decode the colored 3x3 contour motif into a 16x16 periodic lattice with the motif stamped in maroon at the center.

Input structure:
- The grid is 6x6 with orange background and one non-orange color.
- The non-orange pixels have a tight 3x3 bbox containing one contour glyph.
- The glyph is one of the task's period-3 contour forms: plus, H, X, or four corners.

Rule:
- Decode the 3x3 glyph into the period-3 orange phase tile.
- Fill a black 16x16 canvas by repeating that orange phase tile.
- Tile the original 3x3 glyph 2x2 and recolor its true pixels to maroon in the centered 6x6 region.

Key insight:
- The colored object is not copied at its input location; it is a small contour code whose phase tells where orange appears in the repeated lattice.

Mirror the smallest non-axis foreground color across the full straight axis.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color forms exactly one full row, column, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal reflection axis.
- The remaining foreground colors include a unique least-populated color to copy.

Rule
- Preserve the input grid.
- Select every pixel of the unique smallest non-axis foreground color.
- Reflect those pixels across the full straight axis and paint the reflected positions with the same color.

Key insight
- The axis color marks the mirror line, while the color population chooses which set of objects is duplicated.

Drop the singleton marker into the matching red U-shaped container, or make a bottom-row puddle if no closed container is hit.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background, one singleton marker pixel on the top row,
  and one other foreground color forming vertical bars and bottom segments.
- A closed container is a U shape: two vertical side bars with a continuous
  bottom segment between them and an empty rectangular interior above the bottom.

Rule
- Remove the top marker from its original cell.
- If exactly one closed U-shaped container has the marker column within its
  horizontal footprint, fill that container's empty interior with the marker color.
- If no closed container is under the marker column, fill the whole bottom row
  with the marker color.

Key insight
- The marker does not identify a color by value; it identifies a vertical drop
  column, and only a structurally closed U shape can catch and contain the fill.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
