Expand the colored runs from the left reference panel into the blank right panel.

Input structure:
- A uniform rectangular frame surrounds the grid.
- One full-height divider of the frame color splits a left reference panel
  from a blank right panel.
- Both panels have one background margin column on each side of their active
  columns; the left active columns contain two-column endpoint slots, possibly
  connected by same-color horizontal runs.

Rule:
- Keep the original grid and paint only in the right panel's active columns.
- A source run exactly matching the left endpoint slot is copied to the left
  two columns of the right active span.
- A source run exactly matching the right endpoint slot is copied to the right
  two columns of the right active span.
- A source run connecting the endpoint slots is stretched across the entire
  right active span.

Key insight:
The left panel is a compressed legend for the right panel: endpoint markers
stay two pixels wide, while connectors between endpoints expand to fill the
distance between them.

Attach monochrome sprites to the matching sides of a central hollow square.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A hollow NxN square (hub) with bg corners/interior and four differently-colored edges (top, bottom, left, right).
- 2-4 monochrome sprites scattered on the grid, each matching one hub edge color.

Rule:
- For each hub edge color, find the matching sprite outside the hub.
- Rotate the sprite (0/90/180/270°) so its contact edge has exactly N-2 contiguous cells aligned with the hub side, and the rotated sprite is mirror-symmetric along the contact-edge axis (UD for left/right, LR for top/bottom).
- Translate it to adjoin that hub side. 
- Clear everything else to bg; output is hub + attached sprites only.

Key insight: Each edge color uniquely pairs a sprite to a side; symmetry along the contact-edge axis disambiguates the correct rotation.

Normalize the framed input motif into a 5x5 icon and stamp two copies on a 15x15 canvas.

Input structure
The input is a rounded rectangular frame: the four corners are the background
color, and every other outer-border pixel has one frame color. Non-background
pixels inside that frame are the motif to preserve.

Rule
Make a 5x5 version of the rounded frame with a 3x3 interior. Crop the input
interior motif to its bounding box, center that crop in the 3x3 interior, and
paste the resulting 5x5 icon at upper-left positions (2, 2) and (8, 8) in a
15x15 background canvas.

Key insight
The variable-size frame is only a carrier; the meaningful object is the
compact interior motif, which is normalized to the fixed 3x3 icon interior.

Recolor the grey diagonal-chain regions in an orange field to teal.

Input structure
The input contains only grey pixels and orange pixels.  Grey pixels form
several 8-connected regions embedded in the orange field.

Rule
Decompose each grey 8-connected region into 4-connected lobes.  Recolor the
whole region teal only when it contains a straight diagonal run of at least
three pixels and those lobes meet only by diagonal corner contacts in a
non-branching diagonal chain or cycle; a single 4-connected region is
recolored only when it is a square diagonal staircase.

Key insight
The teal regions are not selected by size or position; they are the grey
regions whose internal connectivity depends on diagonal corner joins, while
same-edge cracks, rectangles, bars, and branching/noisy regions remain grey.

Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by replacing singleton markers, filling short orthogonal gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
- Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
- Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all singleton pixels.
- Red singleton markers are missing line cells; yellow singleton markers are directional controls next to a line endpoint.

Rule:
- Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, preferring an endpoint supported along that same axis.
- For each line color, fill the gap between consecutive facing endpoints in a row or column.
- A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
- At crossings, yellow-control rays win; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while pure filled crossings use the lower color id.

Key insight: The singleton markers identify which sparse stroke fragments belong together; after they are colored, the intended lines are the axis-aligned gaps between facing endpoints, with yellow controls flipping one arm to the marked side.

Reorder 5×5 blocks into a connected strip by matching edge foreground pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = background; sep = divider color (full row/column lines).
- Several 5×5 sprite blocks in a grid, separated by sep lines.

Rule:
- Two blocks "connect" when their facing edges share foreground pixels at the same offset (e.g., A's right edge ∩ B's left edge).
- Chain all blocks in the orientation (horizontal or vertical) that admits a complete sequence.
- Output is a 1×N strip of blocks in chain order, separated by sep lines.

Key insight: Edge-contact overlap determines both block ordering and output orientation.

Complete every colored sprite by applying the union of all aligned partial sprite masks.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each non-background color appears as a separated partial copy of one common sprite mask.
- The copies share a top-left-aligned sprite window; some copies may be missing lower or right edge pixels.

Rule:
- Crop each same-color mask to its bounding box.
- Pad the crops to the maximum observed height and width, aligned at the top-left, and OR them into one complete template.
- Fill that template at every sprite location using the sprite's own color.

Key insight:
- No single input sprite is complete, but their missing cells are complementary, so the aligned union reveals the full mask.

Expand the sparse dot lattice into a 26x26 drawing with thick bars between adjacent matching dots.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground pixels lie on logical rows and columns separated by background spacer rows/columns.
- A logical row or column is present when it contains at least one foreground pixel.

Rule
- Expand every background spacer row/column to thickness 2.
- Expand the logical rows/columns equally so the full output is 26x26.
- Paint each foreground logical pixel as a solid rectangle of its color.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels horizontally through the intervening spacer.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels vertically only when neither endpoint is part of a horizontal same-color run.

Key insight
- The input is a sampled line drawing: horizontal same-color runs define the bars first, and only unclaimed same-color vertical neighbors are joined.

Rotate the colors around every 3x3 foreground ring, with corners and side-centers cycling in opposite directions.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Each 4-connected foreground object is a complete 3x3 ring: eight foreground pixels around a background center.

Rule
- For each ring, move corner colors one step around the four corners.
- Move side-center colors one step around the four side centers in the opposite direction.
- Leave the background center and all other background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Corners and side centers form two separate four-cycles on the same 3x3 ring.

Shear the rectangular input down-left onto a black canvas.

Input structure
A rectangular grid of colored pixels with no internal empty region to infer.

Rule
Create a black output with the same height and width W + H - 1, then copy
each input row r unchanged starting at column H - 1 - r.

Key insight
The colors and row contents are preserved; only the row offsets change so
the left edge forms a descending diagonal.

Recolor the separated outer regions by rotating their colors one step clockwise around the yellow-orange divider.

Input structure:
- The grid contains a fixed yellow/orange divider structure.
- All other colors form separated 4-connected monochrome regions around that divider.

Rule:
- Leave the yellow and orange pixels unchanged.
- Sort the non-divider regions by their centroid angle around the divider centroid in screen-coordinate clockwise order.
- Each region keeps its cells and receives the color of the previous region in that cyclic order.

Key insight:
- The objects do not move; only the color labels cycle through the spatial order of the regions around the divider.

Carve color-matched motifs into solid blocks and pack them into a compact grid.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several solid 5×5 monochrome blocks, each a distinct non-bg color.
- For each block color, a small same-colored motif sprite elsewhere on the grid.

Rule:
- Match each motif to its same-colored 5×5 block.
- Center the motif within the block and recolor those cells to bg (punching holes).
- Pack all carved blocks into an output grid preserving their original row/column order, separated by 1-cell gaps and a 1-cell outer border.

Key insight: The motif acts as a stencil — it's not stamped onto the block but carved out of it as background holes.

Fill rectangles between diagonal marker pairs using a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg grid with a vertical legend at the bottom-left: each row is a (marker_color, fill_color) pair.
- Scattered L-shaped corner markers of each marker color define opposite corners of axis-aligned rectangles.
- Some markers are solid 2×2 blocks instead of corner pairs.

Rule:
- Read legend bottom-to-top; for each entry find all pixels of that marker color.
- Determine which two bbox corners carry L-shaped anchors — the *other* diagonal defines the fill region.
- Fill the diamond (all shortest-path cells between those two corners) with the legend's fill color.
- Solid 2×2 marker blocks are simply recolored to the fill color.
- Later legend entries are protected from earlier fills.

Key insight: The L-shaped anchors sit on the marker diagonal; the fill goes on the opposite diagonal of the bounding box.

Erase the complete interior glyph and expand each endpoint marker pair into its color's full glyph.

Input structure
- The grid is 20x20 with background inside two same-color full-height vertical frame bars.
- Inside the frame there is one complete color glyph and one or more other colors appearing only as two endpoint markers in the same row.
- Marker endpoints are always in the first and last interior columns.

Rule
- Keep the vertical frame unchanged.
- Erase any complete interior glyph.
- For each endpoint marker pair, use that marker color's learned glyph template and anchor its horizontal bar on the marker row.

Key insight
- Color identifies which glyph shape to draw; the two endpoint pixels are not copied objects, they are anchors for reconstructing that color's full symbol.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Assemble scattered colored fragments into a left-right symmetric rectangle, jigsaw-style.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; remaining colors form small sprite fragments.
- Optional roles: 4 singleton pixels of one color mark corners; horizontal bars mark top/bottom edges; paired vertical lines mark left/right edges.

Rule:
- Collect all non-bg connected components as jigsaw pieces.
- Determine output rectangle dimensions from total piece area.
- Pack pieces into the rectangle so it is exactly mirror-symmetric (left-right) and same-color pieces never 4-touch.

Key insight: Left-right symmetry plus the no-same-color-touching constraint make the assembly unique; corner/edge markers anchor it when present.

Replace the active black cutout's tail with background and mark the cutout side facing a colored source region.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background, with black rectangle-plus-tail cutouts, one gray source region, and colored distractors.
- Non-gray colored regions and single pixels are distractors/blockers, even when they are multi-pixel staircase shapes.

Rule:
- Find each black cutout whose largest solid rectangle leaves exactly a two-pixel tail.
- The active gray source region is visible only by horizontal rays through background from a cutout's left or right side.
- Select the unique cutout side with the most same-source visible rows, erase that cutout's tail to background, and recolor the full selected vertical side pink (6).

Key insight:
- The colored regions do not move; their horizontal line-of-sight identifies which rectangular cutout is being opened and which side receives the pink mark.

Emit diagonal beams from framed 2x2 blocks through frame gaps; beams interact on collision.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall color (e.g. green) forms 4x4 frames around 2x2 monochrome blocks.
- Each frame has one or more gap pixels where the wall is missing.

Rule:
- Each gap emits a beam of the inner block's color, traveling diagonally outward (direction set by gap position relative to the block).
- Beams paint every cell they cross until they hit the grid edge or collide.
- 90° collision: both beams turn 45° toward their bisector direction; the intersection cell is left blank (1-pixel gap).
- 45° collision: beams merge into a zigzag (alternating cardinal + diagonal steps) with no gap at the meeting point.

Key insight: Two distinct collision rules — 90° produces a gap and single-pixel diagonal lines; 45° produces no gap and thicker zigzag bands.

Complete sparse nested rectangular color layers into solid rectangles.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and every foreground color marks one
axis-aligned rectangular layer; the layer bboxes have unique areas and are
nested from outermost to innermost.
Rule
Take each color's bbox as its completed rectangle, except that a child bbox
which already matches at least three sides of its parent's one-pixel inset
expands to that full inset; repaint the rectangles largest to smallest.
Key insight
The scattered pixels are samples of nested rectangular regions, so the
output is a clean redraw of those regions with inner colors overwriting
outer colors.

Move each marked L-shaped sprite onto the separate pixel matching its marker color.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground has 4-connected multicolor sprites and isolated one-pixel controls.
- Each sprite has one repeated body color in an L shape plus one embedded marker
  pixel of a different color.

Rule
- If the embedded marker color also appears as a separate isolated control pixel,
  translate the whole sprite so the body L-bend lands on that control pixel.
- Clear each moved sprite from its old position, clear its consumed control pixel,
  then paste all translated sprites; sprites without a matching control stay put.

Key insight
- The marker color pairs a sprite with its destination control, while the L-bend
  gives the orientation-independent anchor cell to place on that destination.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
