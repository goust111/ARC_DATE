Replace each marker below the separator with the mapped top legend square centered on that marker.

Input structure:
- The background surrounds a top legend, one solid non-background separator row, and a lower marker field.
- The legend contains equal-size filled square sprites, with a singleton marker below each sprite and aligned to its center column.
- The lower field contains only background and marker colors from the legend.

Rule:
- Pair legend markers to legend sprites by left-to-right position.
- Discard the legend and separator; keep the grid width and the rows below the separator.
- In the lower field, replace every marker pixel by a filled square of the paired sprite color, centered at the marker location.

Key insight: The top area is a positional color legend, and the actual output is the post-separator marker field expanded by that legend.

Move each source pixel toward the separator when it matches its aligned reference pixel, otherwise to the far edge.

Input structure:
- A single full separator line is part of a rectangular frame; the frame's
  extra cells mark the reference side.
- On the reference side, one row or column of colored pixels is aligned
  with one row or column of source pixels on the opposite side.
- Each side has its own dominant background color.

Rule:
- Compare each source pixel with the reference pixel on the same row or column.
- If their colors match, place the source pixel in the cell adjacent to the
  separator on the source side.
- If their colors differ, place the source pixel on the far outer edge along
  the same row or column.
- Erase the original source pixels to the source-side background; keep the
  frame and reference pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The extra frame cells identify which side is the reference; equality with the
aligned reference pixel decides whether each source pixel moves inward or outward.

Add the two missing colored arms of a centered diamond-sprite motif, or clear a completed motif to a blank square.

Input structure
An 11x11 board has orange background and pink separator bars forming nine 3x3 cells. Occupied cells contain a four-pixel diamond sprite; the center cell and one neighboring cell are red, and a completed board may also contain one grey and one teal sprite.

Rule
With only the two red sprites present, preserve the board and add grey and teal diamond sprites 135 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise from the non-center red arm. If those expected grey and teal sprites are already present, output an all-background square whose side length is the total number of sprite pixels.

Key insight
The non-center red sprite is an eight-neighbor direction from the center; the other two colored arms are fixed rotations of that direction.

Expand the top-left horizontal bar into a wrapped sequence of increasing and decreasing foreground runs.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background color and exactly one foreground color.
- All foreground pixels form one contiguous horizontal bar in the top row.
- The bar starts at the left edge; its length is the control value n.

Rule:
- Build a one-dimensional sequence of foreground runs with lengths
  1, 2, ..., n, n-1, ..., 2, 1.
- Separate adjacent runs by one background pixel.
- Wrap the sequence row-major across the input width and pad the final row
  with background pixels.

Key insight:
The output preserves the input width; the bar length controls the run-length
diamond, and the apparent 2D pattern is just that 1D sequence wrapped into rows.

Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

Reorder the vertical color-major blocks while preserving every block's internal pixels.

Input structure
The grid is divided into vertical blocks, each with a unique dominant color.
Small marker pixels from other block colors may appear inside the blocks.

Rule
If adjacent shared-color marker rows read exactly as the current block order
from right to left, reverse the blocks. Otherwise move the leftmost block to
the far right and shift the remaining blocks left.

Key insight
The transformation acts on whole vertical blocks, so marker pixels move with
their source block instead of being recolored or independently rearranged.

Push every colored object touching maroon markers straight outward until it reaches the grid edge.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Maroon pixels are fixed markers.
- Every other foreground 4-connected object touches the marker pixels on exactly one cardinal side.

Rule:
- Clear each non-background, non-maroon object from its original position.
- Translate it in the direction away from its maroon contact until the object reaches the grid boundary.
- Keep the maroon marker pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The maroon contact side is a launcher: it determines a unique outward ray for the whole object, and the edge of the grid determines the translation distance.

Slide a solid square through a winding channel to reach a same-sized target square.

Input structure:
- bg (most common color). A river color forms a winding corridor.
- Two same-sized NxN solid squares on the river: mover and destination, each a distinct color.

Rule:
- The mover square travels along the river toward the destination.
- It can only pass through positions where the full NxN area is river.
- If reachable, the mover replaces the destination; otherwise it stops at the farthest reachable point.
- The mover's original position is filled with the river color.

Key insight: Chokepoints narrower than N pixels block the square, forcing it to stop short.

Replicate a motif across quadrants with scaling and reflection keyed to red anchor blocks.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into four quadrants by a full-row and full-column divider of a single non-bg color.
- Each quadrant contains a red (2) square anchor block of varying size.
- The top-left quadrant also has a colored motif attached to its red anchor.

Rule:
- Use the top-left quadrant's motif as the source pattern.
- For each other quadrant, scale the motif by the ratio of that quadrant's red block size to the source red block size.
- Reflect horizontally for right-side quadrants, vertically for bottom quadrants (both for bottom-right).
- Align the scaled/reflected motif so its red region overlaps the target anchor, then stamp non-bg pixels.

Key insight: Red block size encodes the scale factor; quadrant position encodes the reflection axes.

Cut a sprite along border-control rays and slide pieces to grid corners.

Input structure:
- bg, fg (main object, ~centered), ctrl (1-2 pixels on grid edges).

Rule:
- Draw rays inward from each ctrl pixel along its row/col, painting only bg cells up to the farthest fg pixel (intermittent).
- Rays partition the grid; fg on the cut line stays in place.
- Cut pieces in regions touching a control edge slide to that corner; others vanish.

Key insight: Only regions sharing a border edge with a control pixel keep their piece; the ray skips fg cells.

Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Compress the L-shaped cue to three rows and add a pink copy of the top-row foreground mask.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a two-color top row, and all
foreground pixels below the top row lie in the first column as vertical markers.

Rule
Keep the input top row as output row 0 and the first marker row as output row 1.
Output row 2 is background except at the top-row foreground columns, which are
recolored pink.

Key insight
The lower repeated marker rows only identify the vertical cue; the generated
row is a recolored mask of the horizontal cue in the top row.

Pack the non-background rows from three separated panels into one panel, scanning panels right-to-left.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid contains three equal-size panels separated by two full-height divider columns.
- The background is the dominant color; divider pixels use a color that appears only in the divider columns.

Rule:
- Read panels from right to left, and within each panel read rows from top to bottom.
- Keep each row that contains any non-background pixel, discarding all-background rows.
- Place the kept rows at the bottom of a single panel-shaped output, padding above with background rows.

Key insight:
- The task is row packing: the divider columns mark independent panels, and only the occupied rows are moved.

Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Move each maroon marker toward the blue rectangle and recolor the rectangle red.

Input structure
A background canvas contains one solid blue rectangular object and several isolated
maroon marker pixels. Each marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the
rectangle and lies outside it.

Rule
Start with a background canvas, repaint the blue rectangle red, and move each
maroon marker straight toward the rectangle along its row or column. Exactly one
marker is strictly closer to the rectangle than all others and enters the
rectangle boundary; every other marker lands in the adjacent exterior cell just
outside its aligned side.

Key insight
The single entering marker is the unique global nearest marker to the rectangle,
not the nearest marker on each of the four sides.

Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Render the filled-square object counts as compact nested stacks ordered by count rank.

Input structure
A large noisy grid has a dominant background, scattered non-square noise, and
filled monochrome square objects. Each square side length has exactly one
object color, and side lengths form consecutive sizes.

Rule
Ignore non-square components. If the lowest square in the scene is of the
smallest side length, treat that one smallest square as a distractor and do
not count it. For count rank k from left to right, create one block from all
square sizes with at least k remaining objects; draw larger squares first and
smaller squares over their upper-left corner, then append one background
separator column.

Key insight
The output is a count histogram of square side lengths, but each histogram
slot is rendered as nested upper-left square masks using the side colors.

Red diamond outlines contract by one layer and gray diamond outlines expand by one layer while other objects stay fixed.

Input structure
- A 16x16 orange-background grid contains one-cell-thick Manhattan-diamond outlines.
- Red and gray outlines are the changing objects; other colored diamond outlines are static.
- Some outlines may be clipped by the grid boundary, but their visible pixels still fit a clipped Manhattan-distance contour.
Rule
- Clear all red and gray pixels.
- Red objects are redrawn with the same diamond center and radius minus one.
- Gray objects are redrawn with radius plus one; an ambiguous edge-clipped growing arc continues away from the nearest perpendicular edge.
Key insight
- The task is not about moving whole objects: each changing object is a contour of a diamond, and the visible operation is one step of contour contraction or expansion.

Reorder and stack rectangles by proximity to two colored edge lines.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two edge lines (h + v) meet at a corner marked by a unique color.
- "Blue" line is color 1 if present, else the longer line; other is "red."
- Solid rectangles in the interior.

Rule:
- Sort rectangles by (distance to blue edge, distance to red edge).
- If the blue edge is vertical, rotate each rectangle 90° CCW.
- Stack top-to-bottom, centered horizontally.

Key insight: Edge-line colors encode a coordinate system; proximity to each axis determines stacking order and rotation.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
