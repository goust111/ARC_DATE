Extend each top-row control pixel downward as a vertical toggle ray in its own color.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Non-background pixels on the top row are control pixels, each identifying
  one column and one ray color.
- Foreground regions below may intersect these control columns.

Rule:
- For every top-row control pixel, process the cells below it in the same
  column down to the bottom edge.
- A cell that already has the control color is erased to the background.
- Every other cell on that downward ray is painted with the control color.
- The top-row control pixels themselves remain unchanged.

Key insight:
The top row is a set of vertical ray launchers; each ray toggles only cells
matching its own color and overwrites all other colors along that column.

Cast yellow horizontal and vertical rays from the teal rectangle until blue blockers stop them.

Input structure:
- A black-background grid containing one solid teal rectangle.
- Blue objects are blockers; other non-background objects may lie in the ray paths.
- Yellow is absent from the input and is the output paint color.

Rule:
- From every row of the teal rectangle, cast rays left and right to the grid edge.
- From every column of the teal rectangle, cast rays up and down to the grid edge.
- A ray stops before a blue pixel; all crossed non-blue, non-teal pixels become yellow.

Key insight:
The teal rectangle defines a full cross-shaped projection, while blue objects are walls and red/background cells are simply paintable space.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

Move each marked L-shaped sprite onto the separate pixel matching its marker color.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground has 4-connected multicolor sprites and isolated one-pixel controls.
- Each sprite has one repeated body color in an L shape plus one embedded marker
  pixel of a different color.

Rule
- If the embedded marker color also appears as a separate isolated control pixel,
  translate the whole sprite so the body L-bend lands on that control pixel.
- Clear each moved sprite from its old position, clear its consumed control pixel,
  then paste all translated sprites; sprites without a matching control stay put.

Key insight
- The marker color pairs a sprite with its destination control, while the L-bend
  gives the orientation-independent anchor cell to place on that destination.

Repair markers embedded in the main object and copy the remaining markers one pixel toward the solid edge.

Input structure:
- A mostly background grid contains one solid non-background edge line.
- Apart from that edge and the background, there is one large main object
  color and a smaller marker color.
- Each marker is either embedded in the main object, touching it on at
  least three 4-neighbor sides, or isolated on the background.

Rule:
- Embedded markers are recolored to the main object color.
- Isolated background markers remain in place and also paint the adjacent
  background pixel in the direction of the solid edge line.
- All other pixels are unchanged.

Key insight:
The full edge line is a direction cue: it tells which way the background
markers extend, while markers surrounded by the main object are simply
defects to be filled.

Extend each of two aligned rectangular marker objects toward the other, filling half of the gap across the full perpendicular span.

Input structure
- A dominant background contains exactly two solid, same-sized monochromatic rectangles.
- The rectangles share either the same row span or the same column span, with a background gap between their facing edges.

Rule
- If the rectangles are side-by-side, color the left half of the inter-object gap across every row with the left object's color, and the right half with the right object's color.
- If one rectangle is above the other, color the upper half of the gap across every column with the upper object's color, and the lower half with the lower object's color.
- When the gap length is odd, leave the center row/column as background.

Key insight
- The marker objects are endpoints of an axial corridor; their own size identifies the facing edge, while the filled corridor spans the whole grid perpendicular to that axis.

Drop the blue sprites downward relative to the red divider, with vertical sprites passing through to the bottom.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a single full-width horizontal divider row.
- The other non-background color forms 4-connected sprites above the divider.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite pixels.
- A one-column sprite falls to the bottom of its column and deletes the divider
  pixel it crossed.
- Any wider sprite falls until its unique widest horizontal row is immediately
  above the divider row; if the moved sprite overlaps the divider, it covers it.

Key insight:
The red row is not a generic floor: only one-column sprites pass through to the
bottom, while wider sprites are registered by their widest horizontal segment.

Extend each colored marker from its directional sprite to a grid edge, painting a dotted ray and the whole edge side.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One repeated body color forms small 8-connected directional sprites.
- Each marker is a singleton non-background, non-body color embedded in one sprite.

Rule:
- The body pixels around a marker lie mostly behind it; the opposite direction is the marker's ray direction.
- Paint every second pixel from the marker along that ray, then paint the entire boundary side reached by the ray.
- If two painted boundary sides meet at a corner, make that shared corner black.

Key insight:
- The same seven-pixel body sprite rotates to encode the direction; its local center-of-mass bias points away from the ray.

Fill the background under a top-row red/grey span with a shrinking diagonal pattern that alternates red and grey.

Input structure:
- The grid has an orange background.
- All foreground pixels are red or grey and lie on the top row.
- The first and last top-row foreground pixels define an odd-width span.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- For row r below the top, fill columns span_left + r through span_right - r.
- Each filled cell takes the top-row color r columns up-left, flipped red<->grey once per row step.

Key insight:
- The output is the top-row span propagated down-right along diagonals, while the allowable region shrinks inward from both ends each row.

Erase the first border pixel hit by extending the red marker away from its pink trail.

Input structure
- The dominant background surrounds a unique red marker and a four-pixel
  pink trail.
- The pink pixels form one straight 8-connected ray starting next to the
  red marker.
- In the opposite direction from that trail, the red marker faces a
  non-background border or obstacle pixel beyond background cells.

Rule
- Keep the whole grid fixed except for the first non-background pixel on
  the ray from the red marker away from the pink trail.
- Recolor that one hit pixel to the background color.

Key insight
- The pink trail marks where the red marker came from, so the edit is found
  by ray-casting from the red marker in the opposite direction.

Keep the largest 8-connected motif and replace the corner/control pixels with a solid corner triangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Exactly one grid corner contains a foreground control pixel; it gives the
  corner from which the triangle is painted.
- There is one unique largest 8-connected monochrome foreground object, the
  motif that remains in the output; all other foreground pixels are controls.
- Every foreground component outside that motif is a singleton control pixel.
- The fill color is the unique control color that appears in at least two
  non-corner control pixels.

Rule
- Start from a blank background canvas and redraw only the largest motif.
- Count the non-corner control pixels; that count is the triangle side.
- Paint the fill color on the right-triangle region where those two distances
  from the marked corner's edges sum to less than the side length.

Key insight
- The scattered singleton controls are counted into a compact triangular
  stack at the marked corner; only the largest motif is not part of the count.

Recolor the sparse foreground pixels in scan order along their longer spread, cycling red, teal, and grey.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Every foreground object is a single isolated 4-connected pixel.
- The foreground pixel set has a rectangular bbox whose row or column extent defines the scan direction.

Rule:
- Keep the background unchanged.
- If the foreground bbox is at least as tall as it is wide, order foreground pixels row-major; otherwise order them column-major.
- Recolor the ordered pixels by repeating red, teal, grey from the first pixel onward.

Key insight:
- The original foreground colors are only markers; the output color depends on each marker's ordinal position in the dominant scan direction.

Paint each pink control pixel as a teal horizontal bar whose reach equals the foreground counts on that row.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one or more pink control pixels.
- Each marker row has exactly one pink pixel; all other non-background pixels
  in that row are counters.
Rule
- Start from an all-background output grid.
- For each pink pixel, count non-background pixels strictly to its left and
  strictly to its right in the same row.
- Paint teal from c - left_count through c + right_count on that row.
Key insight
- The foreground pixels are not copied; only their counts on each side of
  each pink marker encode the teal bar length.

Drop every large foreground object straight down to the bottom while leaving small marker objects fixed.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color and exactly one foreground color.
- The foreground is split into separated 4-connected objects.
- Objects of area at most three are stationary markers; larger objects are moving sprites.

Rule:
- Clear each moving sprite from its original position.
- Translate each moving sprite vertically downward until its bbox bottom reaches the grid bottom.
- Repaint each translated sprite in its original color; small markers stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- Object area separates the active falling sprites from the small fixed markers, and all active sprites follow the same vertical path.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Compute a grey result bar by adding teal bar heights and subtracting red bar heights.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several bottom-aligned one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Teal bars are positive operands; red bars are negative operands.
- The penultimate column is an empty result slot.

Rule
- Keep every input bar unchanged.
- Compute result height = total teal bar height - total red bar height.
- Paint that many bottom cells of the penultimate column grey.

Key insight
- The bars encode arithmetic by height, with color providing the sign.

Connect same-color diagonal pixel pairs, then emit perpendicular rays from differently-colored pixels on those diagonals.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Line color (e.g. blue) has pixel pairs aligned on shared diagonals. Trigger color (e.g. magenta) pixels sit along those diagonals.

Rule:
- Draw diagonal lines connecting each pair of same-color aligned pixels.
- Where the diagonal crosses a trigger pixel, emit perpendicular diagonal rays (in the trigger's color) extending to the grid boundary.

Key insight: Trigger pixels act as beam-splitters — the perpendicular rays rotate 90° from the connecting diagonal's orientation.

Within each horizontal pair of two-color panels, swap the motif masks and recolor each pasted mask with the source panel's base color.

Input structure:
- A separator color forms full blank rows and at least one full blank column.
- The non-separator area is split into row bands, each containing exactly two same-shaped rectangular panels.
- Each panel has a dominant base color and one minority motif color.

Rule:
- For every row band, clear each panel to its own base color.
- Paste the right panel's motif mask into the left panel using the right base color.
- Paste the left panel's motif mask into the right panel using the left base color.

Key insight:
- The motif colors themselves are distractors; only each motif's shape mask and the two panel base colors are exchanged.

Replace the active black cutout's tail with background and mark the cutout side facing a colored source region.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background, with black rectangle-plus-tail cutouts, one gray source region, and colored distractors.
- Non-gray colored regions and single pixels are distractors/blockers, even when they are multi-pixel staircase shapes.

Rule:
- Find each black cutout whose largest solid rectangle leaves exactly a two-pixel tail.
- The active gray source region is visible only by horizontal rays through background from a cutout's left or right side.
- Select the unique cutout side with the most same-source visible rows, erase that cutout's tail to background, and recolor the full selected vertical side pink (6).

Key insight:
- The colored regions do not move; their horizontal line-of-sight identifies which rectangular cutout is being opened and which side receives the pink mark.

Use the left-edge color legend to draw a padded rectangular halo around each matching object while preserving enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- One or more two-row markers sit on the left edge; each marker is a 2x2 block whose left column is an object color and right column is its halo color.
- Away from the markers, every source color from the legend appears as one or more 4-connected monochrome objects.

Rule:
- Keep the input pixels unchanged.
- For each source-color object, take its tight bbox expanded by one cell and clipped to the grid.
- Recolor background pixels in that expanded region to the marker's halo color, except for background holes enclosed by the object.

Key insight:
- The small left-edge bars are a legend: they map object colors to the colors used for the surrounding padded bbox.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
