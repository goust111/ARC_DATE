<description>
Swap paired marker pixels across the largest foreground-color barrier, placing them just outside the barrier segment.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color is the unique most frequent non-background color; its pixels form the stationary barrier.
- Other foreground pixels are single markers, sometimes paired on opposite sides of one contiguous barrier segment in the same row or column.

Rule:
- Scan each row and column that crosses exactly one contiguous barrier segment.
- If the line has exactly one marker on each side of that segment, erase both source markers and place each marker in the cell immediately beyond the opposite side of the segment.
- Lines with markers on only one side are unchanged; the barrier remains unchanged.

Key insight:
- The marker pairing is local to a row or column, and the destination is defined by the nearest cells outside the intervening barrier segment, not by the original distance from the barrier.

Extract the single plain rectangle and redraw it with the aligned rectangles' border-relative marker pattern.

Input structure:
- The boundary color is the background/separator.
- Foreground objects are dense rectangular regions; exactly one rectangle has only its base color.
- Other rectangles contain their base color plus marker pixels.

Rule:
- Crop the only plain rectangle; this crop is the output canvas.
- Use marked rectangles whose row span overlaps the plain rectangle's row span.
- Transfer their marker pixels by preserving each marker run's distance from the nearest rectangle edges.

Key insight:
- The marked rectangles are examples of an edge-relative pattern, so the missing plain rectangle receives the same pattern resized to its own dimensions.

Recolor the small defect bars on each shared-color object with the opposite panel color.

Input structure
- The grid contains two large panel colors and one shared object color.
- Each shared-color object is a mostly solid rectangle inside exactly one panel.
Rule
- Find the near-solid rectangular core of each object.
- Missing core pixels and one-cell protrusions define two-pixel bars perpendicular to the nearest core edge.
- Recolor those bars with the other panel color; leave all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The colors to add are not tied to numeric ids: each object's surrounding panel identifies the opposite panel color.

Fill holes inside a large template frame using shape-matched outside sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. One large monochrome frame object (template).
- Inside the frame: holes of various shapes (non-frame-color regions).
- Outside the frame: small monochrome sprites scattered on bg.

Rule:
- Crop to the frame's bounding box; fill entirely with frame color.
- For each hole, find an outside sprite whose shape matches (rotation/flip allowed).
- Fill the hole with the matched sprite's color. If multiple sprites match, use the most frequent color.

Key insight: Sprites act as shape-coded color keys — their shape identifies which hole they fill, their color determines the fill color.

Normalize vertical two-color bars between paired marker columns around the marker rows.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- A row of red marker pixels sits directly above a row of gray marker pixels
  in the same alternating columns.
- The columns between adjacent markers contain vertical bars made from a
  contiguous teal run above a contiguous blue run.

Rule
- Keep the marker pixels and all non-bar background cells fixed.
- Let h be the maximum teal-run height among the bar columns; paint teal in
  every bar column for h rows ending at the red marker row.
- In each bar column, move its blue run to start at the gray marker row and
  fill all lower cells in that column with maroon.

Key insight
- The marker rows are a baseline: teal is normalized into a common upper
  band, while each blue run keeps its own height below the baseline.

Emit diagonal beams from framed 2x2 blocks through frame gaps; beams interact on collision.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall color (e.g. green) forms 4x4 frames around 2x2 monochrome blocks.
- Each frame has one or more gap pixels where the wall is missing.

Rule:
- Each gap emits a beam of the inner block's color, traveling diagonally outward (direction set by gap position relative to the block).
- Beams paint every cell they cross until they hit the grid edge or collide.
- 90° collision: both beams turn 45° toward their bisector direction; the intersection cell is left blank (1-pixel gap).
- 45° collision: beams merge into a zigzag (alternating cardinal + diagonal steps) with no gap at the meeting point.

Key insight: Two distinct collision rules — 90° produces a gap and single-pixel diagonal lines; 45° produces no gap and thicker zigzag bands.

Extrapolate the moving sprite from a horizontal sequence of shared-border frames into the next standalone frame.

Input structure
- The grid is a row of equal-width framed panels sharing their vertical border columns.
- Each panel has the same fill color and one identical interior sprite at the same local columns.
- The sprite's top row changes by a constant amount from panel to panel.

Rule
- Build one output panel with the same height, frame color, fill color, and sprite.
- Continue the sprite's diagonal motion one more panel to the right.
- Because the output is a standalone panel, advance by the full panel width, not the shared-border spacing.

Key insight
- The panels are consecutive frames of motion; the output is the next frame after the sequence.

Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Drop the blue sprites downward relative to the red divider, with vertical sprites passing through to the bottom.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a single full-width horizontal divider row.
- The other non-background color forms 4-connected sprites above the divider.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite pixels.
- A one-column sprite falls to the bottom of its column and deletes the divider
  pixel it crossed.
- Any wider sprite falls until its unique widest horizontal row is immediately
  above the divider row; if the moved sprite overlaps the divider, it covers it.

Key insight:
The red row is not a generic floor: only one-column sprites pass through to the
bottom, while wider sprites are registered by their widest horizontal segment.

Repeat each 3x3 control-center sprite toward the matching solid rectangle until a copy first overlaps that rectangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each sprite is a 3x3 foreground object whose eight border pixels have one color and whose center has a different control color.
- For every control color, there is exactly one separate solid rectangular object of that color.

Rule
- Match each sprite to the unique solid rectangle whose color equals the sprite center.
- Copy the whole 3x3 sprite in the cardinal direction of that rectangle, stepping by three cells each time.
- Stop after pasting the first copy whose 3x3 bbox overlaps the rectangle; copied pixels overwrite the rectangle there.

Key insight
The center pixel is not the paint color: it is a destination key, while the entire 3x3 sprite is the motif tiled along the straight path.

Recolor the two diagonal foreground-bar orientations, assigning teal to the larger orientation and red to the smaller one.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground color.
- Foreground pixels form one-cell-thick diagonal bars.
- Every foreground pixel belongs to exactly one diagonal orientation.

Rule
- Keep the background unchanged.
- Classify each foreground pixel by whether it has a diagonal neighbor on the NW/SE axis or the NE/SW axis.
- Recolor the orientation with more foreground pixels teal and the other orientation red.

Key insight
- The output colors depend on the relative population of the two diagonal orientations, not on a fixed slash direction or position.

Complete a grid of colored blocks to match a minimap legend in the top-left corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top-left corner: a small sprite of single colored pixels forming a minimap pattern on a regular lattice.
- Main area: uniformly colored square blocks (NxN) arranged on a regular grid; some positions are empty (bg).

Rule:
- The legend pixels define a color pattern; each pixel's lattice position maps to a block position in the main grid via a fixed scale factor and offset.
- Existing colored blocks confirm the scale/offset alignment.
- For every legend pixel whose corresponding grid position is empty, place a new block of that color.

Key insight: The top-left pixel pattern is a scaled-down minimap of the block layout; the mapping is inferred from blocks already present.

Stamp recolored sprites into a framed region using placeholder positions and a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg background, a rectangular single-color frame, colored placeholder cells inside the frame.
- Outside the frame: sprite shapes (one per placeholder color) and a small legend mapping each placeholder color to an output color.

Rule:
- Find the frame and its interior placeholders.
- For each placeholder color, locate the matching-color sprite outside the frame.
- Stamp each sprite at the placeholder's position inside the frame.
- Recolor every stamped sprite to the output color defined by the legend.

Key insight: The legend pairs (overlapping two-color glyphs outside the frame) dictate the final recoloring — placeholder color selects the shape, legend maps it to the output color.

Pack the non-background rows from three separated panels into one panel, scanning panels right-to-left.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid contains three equal-size panels separated by two full-height divider columns.
- The background is the dominant color; divider pixels use a color that appears only in the divider columns.

Rule:
- Read panels from right to left, and within each panel read rows from top to bottom.
- Keep each row that contains any non-background pixel, discarding all-background rows.
- Place the kept rows at the bottom of a single panel-shaped output, padding above with background rows.

Key insight:
- The task is row packing: the divider columns mark independent panels, and only the occupied rows are moved.

Draw a polyline by decoding 3x3 glyph instructions read across a divided grid.

Input structure:
- Left of a full-height vertical divider: 3x3 colored glyphs on bg.
- Right of divider: a single gray (5) start pixel.

Rule:
- Remove the divider; shift the gray start into the left canvas.
- Read glyphs in column-major order (left→right, top→bottom).
- Each glyph's shape (pixel area) encodes a segment: area 4 → down 2, area 5 → right 3, area 6 → left 4, area 7 → left 2.
- Append segments sequentially, stepping down one cell between each.

Key insight: Glyph pixel count (area) uniquely determines both segment length and direction — the shape itself is the instruction.

Shear the rectangular input down-left onto a black canvas.

Input structure
A rectangular grid of colored pixels with no internal empty region to infer.

Rule
Create a black output with the same height and width W + H - 1, then copy
each input row r unchanged starting at column H - 1 - r.

Key insight
The colors and row contents are preserved; only the row offsets change so
the left edge forms a descending diagonal.

Extend each top-row control pixel downward as a vertical toggle ray in its own color.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Non-background pixels on the top row are control pixels, each identifying
  one column and one ray color.
- Foreground regions below may intersect these control columns.

Rule:
- For every top-row control pixel, process the cells below it in the same
  column down to the bottom edge.
- A cell that already has the control color is erased to the background.
- Every other cell on that downward ray is painted with the control color.
- The top-row control pixels themselves remain unchanged.

Key insight:
The top row is a set of vertical ray launchers; each ray toggles only cells
matching its own color and overwrites all other colors along that column.

Decode a block-grid image by swapping each sprite-coded cell with a solid cell and each blank cell with the sprite.

Input structure
The grid is partitioned by black separator rows and columns into equal-size
square blocks. Each block is either a copy of one two-color sprite or a
uniform blank block of the sprite's minority color; grey pixels are erased
cells that act as wildcards.

Rule
Infer the repeated sprite from fully visible mixed-color blocks. Replace a
block matching that sprite, ignoring grey erasures, with a solid block of
the sprite's majority color. Replace a uniform blank block with the sprite.
Separator rows and columns, including grey erasures on them, become black.

Key insight
The small sprite is a block-level code for one macro-cell state, and the
uniform minority-color block is the other state; the output renders the
opposite code in each macro-cell while cleaning erased pixels.

Compress each colored ray pixel inward until it touches that color's 3x3 anchor block.
Input structure
- A uniform background grid with non-background colors.
- Each foreground color contains one solid 3x3 anchor block; all other pixels of that color lie on straight 8-neighbor rays aimed at that block.
Rule
- Keep anchor blocks fixed, erase loose foreground pixels, and for each ray pack its pixels into consecutive cells adjacent to the anchor along the same ray.
Key insight
- The scattered pixels are displaced pixels on visible row, column, or diagonal sightlines back to their same-colored 3x3 block.

Expand each colored control pixel into its corresponding fixed 4x4 glyph.

Input structure:
- Black background with single-pixel markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and/or 8.
- Some inputs also show a sample 4x4 glyph in the output color, with a same-rule marker just below-right of the sample.

Rule:
- Replace each marker color by its learned 4x4 glyph: 2->yellow frame, 3->blue ring, 5->pink diagonal blocks, 8->orange X.
- Paint each glyph with its top-left corner at the marker pixel, clipping at the grid boundary.
- Remove the sample glyphs and skip their below-right label markers.

Key insight:
- The colored pixels are control pixels for a fixed glyph alphabet; non-control sample glyphs are only legend entries, not preserved scene objects.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。
在符合ARC题目和下述提示词要求的基础上，鼓励多层级结合，但不可为了多层级违背要求。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。例如：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
