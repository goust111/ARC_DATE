Cast yellow horizontal and vertical rays from the teal rectangle until blue blockers stop them.

Input structure:
- A black-background grid containing one solid teal rectangle.
- Blue objects are blockers; other non-background objects may lie in the ray paths.
- Yellow is absent from the input and is the output paint color.

Rule:
- From every row of the teal rectangle, cast rays left and right to the grid edge.
- From every column of the teal rectangle, cast rays up and down to the grid edge.
- A ray stops before a blue pixel; all crossed non-blue, non-teal pixels become yellow.

Key insight:
The teal rectangle defines a full cross-shaped projection, while blue objects are walls and red/background cells are simply paintable space.

Assemble scattered jigsaw sprites around a central yellow anchor by pairing red connector pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = black (0). Several colored sprites scattered on the grid.
- One anchor sprite contains a 3×3 yellow (4) block.
- Each sprite has red (2) connector pixels along its edges.

Rule:
- The anchor stays in place; remaining sprites attach one at a time.
- Each sprite is translated so that one of its red pixels overlaps an unpaired red pixel on the growing assembly.
- Every red connector must pair with exactly one other, forming a complete joined structure.

Key insight: Red pixels act as jigsaw pegs — each must match exactly one counterpart, and the assembly order is determined by which unpaired connectors remain.

Fill every row from the nearest marked horizontal bar, turning bar rows and color-boundary ties into separator rows.

Input structure
- A dominant background fills the grid except for full-width horizontal bars and one vertical marker column.
- Outside the marker column, every row is monochrome: either background or a source bar color.
- Background rows share one marker color in the marker column; source bar rows share the other.

Rule
- Each non-source row takes the color of the nearest source bar, with that row's marker-column pixel set to the source-marker color.
- If a row is exactly midway between nearest bars of different colors, make the whole row the source-marker color.
- Each original source bar row becomes a source-marker row with the marker-column pixel changed to the background-row marker color.

Key insight
- The marked bars are horizontal seeds for a one-dimensional nearest-seed partition over rows; equal-distance rows are separators only when the competing seed colors differ.

Repaint regions from T-shaped control markers, erase the markers, and optionally rotate based on a color-9 L-marker.

Input structure:
- The grid is a mosaic of monochrome regions.
- Color 1 forms T-shaped control markers on region boundaries.
- Some controls use three singleton color-1 pixels around a colored center; that center is a literal replacement color.
- An optional 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker triggers 90-degree rotation of the output.

Rule:
- For a color-1 T marker, the single stem points at the destination region to repaint.
- The two diagonal cells behind the stem identify the source region; the destination gets that source region's original color.
- For a colored-center T marker, the same stem identifies the destination, but the center color is the replacement.
- All marker cells are filled with the final color of the source-side region.
- A 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker controls rotation: ┐ (corner top-right) → CCW 90°, ┌ (corner top-left) → CW 90°.

Key insight:
- The stem chooses what changes, while the two diagonals behind the stem choose where the marker itself belongs.

Count same-color patterns per frame and represent the tally as dots inside.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Hollow rectangular frames in various colors.
- Small monochrome pattern sprites scattered outside frames.

Rule:
- Remove all small patterns from the grid.
- For each frame of color C, count how many patterns share color C.
- Draw that many dots along the frame's center row, spaced by 2, starting from the right.

Key insight: Frames act as tally displays — scattered same-color patterns are "absorbed" and their count is shown as interior dots.

Convert scattered foreground objects into bottom-aligned count bars in a fixed five-color order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and foreground objects in the task
palette: grey, red, teal, maroon, and pink. Objects are monochromatic
8-connected components; some palette colors may be absent.

Rule
For each palette color in order grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, count its
8-connected objects. Create a background grid with five columns and height
equal to the largest count, then fill each column upward from the bottom
with its palette color for that count.

Key insight
The output does not preserve object shapes or positions; it is a histogram
of per-color 8-connected object counts, using the learned palette order.

Keep only the center color and redraw it as a diagonal ray to its indicated corner.

Input structure:
- The grid is an odd square with a unique dominant background color.
- The center pixel is foreground.
- Every off-center pixel with the center color lies in the same diagonal
  quadrant relative to the center.

Rule:
- Fill the whole output with the background color.
- Use the quadrant of the center-colored pixels to choose one diagonal
  direction from the center.
- Draw a continuous line of the center color from the center to the grid
  edge in that direction.

Key insight:
The color at the exact center identifies the surviving color, while the
other pixels of that color identify which corner the center should connect to.

Composite two pattern tiles into a fourth panel using flood-fill from an indicator pixel.

Input structure:
- Four 5×5 panels in one row, border-separated.
- Panel 0: cue pixels = wall boundary (8-connected, edge-to-edge, through center)
           + one 8-isolated indicator pixel.
- Panels 1–2: source patterns. Panel 3: blank (to fill).

Rule:
- Flood-fill (4-conn) from indicator, blocked by wall → inside region.
- Inside → non-bg from panel 1; outside → non-bg from panel 2.
- Wall → panel 1 if non-bg; panel 2 fallback when wall is 4-connected.

Key insight: The cue panel's isolated indicator and wall partition the tile into inside/outside masks that select between the two source panels.

Build the woven rectangle determined by the two marked cells on each crossed bar.

Input structure
A black-background grid contains one long horizontal bar and one long vertical bar.
Each bar has a dominant base color and exactly two same-colored marker pixels.

Rule
The horizontal marker pair gives the output column span.  From the horizontal bar
row, walk toward the farther vertical marker; rows and columns alternate every
other cell.  Even step/even offset cells use the horizontal marker color until
the nearer vertical marker is reached, then use the vertical marker color.
Odd row steps use the horizontal base on marker columns and the original
crossing color on spacer columns.  Spacer columns on even row steps use the
vertical base, except at the switch row where they use the crossing color.

Key insight
The original cross cell records which base color wins at base/base lattice
crossings; the nearer vertical marker is the color-switch boundary.

Keep the larger sprite from each separated panel and overlay those sprites into one 5x5 canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a 5x17 grid: three 5x5 panels separated by one-cell black columns.
- Each panel has the same background color and exactly one foreground color split into two 4-connected components.

Rule:
- In each panel, discard the smaller foreground component and keep the unique largest component as the sprite.
- Process panels left to right, placing each sprite at its panel coordinates on a 5x5 background canvas.
- If a sprite would cover an already placed sprite, slide it by the unique nearest in-bounds offset that avoids overlap.

Key insight:
- The extra same-colored component in each panel is a distractor; the final answer is the non-overlapping overlay of the three largest components.

Replace gray plus-shaped damage masks with the hidden colors of the rectilinear mosaic.

Input structure:
- Color 8 appears only as isolated 3x3 plus masks.
- The non-mask pixels are visible parts of a clean grid made from horizontal
  and vertical color regions.

Rule:
- Treat every color-8 pixel as unknown damage and leave all other pixels fixed.
- First copy unknown pixels from exact matching parallel rows or columns.
- Then fill any remaining mask cells from opposite-side continuations and the
  better-supported local straight edge.

Key insight:
- The gray pluses are occluders, not objects; the underlying colors are
  determined by repeated line templates and nearby axis-aligned boundaries.

Slide each black border rectangle to the opposite border, recoloring its swept stripe orange and leaving the rectangle black at the far edge.

Input structure
- The grid contains black rectangular 4-connected masks, each touching exactly one outer border.
- Grey cells form incidental pattern content; orange is the trail color used when a black mask slides.

Rule
- Treat all black rectangles as moving simultaneously.
- A rectangle touching the top or bottom edge moves vertically to the opposite edge in the same columns.
- A rectangle touching the left or right edge moves horizontally to the opposite edge in the same rows.
- Recolor the complete swept row or column stripe to orange, then stamp every destination rectangle in black.

Key insight
- Edge contact gives the slide direction; the output is the set of opposite-edge black rectangles plus their orange trails.

Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

Decode a stamp map: read templates, markers, and palette from a tiled grid, then render stamps.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into K tile columns (each N wide) separated by 1-col dashed separators.
- Top band (rows 0..N-1): K template masks, one per tile column.
- Middle band (rows N+1..2N): marker pixels whose color picks a template.
- Bottom band (rows 2N+2..): K palette swatches giving the output color per template.
- Separator rows at rows N and 2N+1 (dashed pattern of sep color).

Rule:
- Each marker's local position (lr, lc) within its tile column determines which N×N output block to stamp.
- The marker's color identifies which template to use; the palette recolors the template.

Key insight: Marker color encodes template index; local position within tile column encodes stamp block.

Count colored objects and record tallies inside a legend box.

Input structure:
- A black rectangular legend box with key-color pixels in its leftmost non-black column.
- Outside the box, distinct objects of each key color are scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- For each key color, count separate same-colored objects outside the legend box.
- Output the legend box repainted: each key row gets one dot per object, spaced every other cell rightward from the key pixel.

Key insight: The legend is both the color index and the output canvas — object counts become dot sequences on the matching row.

Crop a board cluster and rotate its color layers based on outside cue sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- A main multi-color board cluster (largest foreground region).
- Small monochrome cue sprites outside the board for the colors that rotate.

Rule:
- Tight-crop around the board cluster.
- For each color layer inside the crop, find its same-color cue outside.
- Rotate that layer clockwise by (cue pixel count mod 4) × 90°.
- No outside cue → no rotation.

Key insight: Cue sprite size mod 4 encodes rotation amount for its matching color layer.

Recolor the large mask crop column-by-column using the separate three-row palette strip.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- One large monochrome foreground object is the mask; its bbox is the output region and may contain background holes.
- The remaining foreground is a 3-row palette rectangle with the same width as the mask bbox: two identical color rows and one uniform row.

Rule:
- Crop to the mask object's bbox.
- For each output column, color mask pixels with the corresponding color from the repeated palette rows.
- Replace background holes inside the crop with the palette's uniform third-row color.

Key insight:
The grey object is only a stencil; its columns select colors from the legend, while its holes expose the legend's fill color.

Paint an inner border around the region reachable from a corner marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; wall color (blue) forms barriers dividing the grid.
- A unique single pixel (magenta) sits on one corner — the start marker.
- Some wall-colored pixels are structural (border-touching, enclosing regions); others are decorations.

Rule:
- Flood-fill from the marker corner to find all reachable bg cells, blocked by structural walls.
- Erase wall-colored decorations hidden behind structural walls (not reachable from marker side).
- Paint orange (color 7) on every reachable bg cell adjacent to a wall or grid edge — forming a 1-cell inner border.

Key insight: Only border-connected wall components act as real barriers; interior wall fragments are decorations to be removed.

Predict the next panel in a framed sequence by continuing each scheduled colored interval.

Input structure
- The grid is made from three or more equal panels in one row or one column.
- The final input panel is the static target template; every earlier panel differs from it only by dynamic colors absent from the template.
- Each dynamic color appears in a regular temporal schedule across the earlier panels.

Rule
- Keep the final template panel as the output canvas.
- For every dynamic color whose schedule reaches the next panel, compare its last two appearances.
- Extrapolate each one-dimensional interval along the color's changing row or column axis and paint that predicted mask.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for the last visible panel, but for the next frame after the blank/template slot.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。
在符合ARC题目和下述提示词要求的基础上，鼓励多层级结合，但不可为了多层级违背要求。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。例如：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
