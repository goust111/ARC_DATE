Stagger the two horizontal input regions onto a larger maroon separator canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a rectangular grid with an even number of rows.
- The top half and bottom half are the two regions to preserve.
- Maroon is absent from the input and is used only as the new separator color.

Rule:
- Create an output with one extra row and one extra column, filled with maroon.
- Copy the top half into the upper-left corner.
- Copy the bottom half one row below the top region and one column to the right.

Key insight:
The output is not a recoloring of either region; it inserts an L-shaped maroon
gap by diagonally offsetting the lower half from the upper half.

Convert each colored partitioned frame into a horizontal bar whose length is its number of enclosed regions.

Input structure:
- Black background with several axis-aligned colored line drawings.
- The line drawings are damaged by scattered pixels of one non-background noise color and by overlaps with other drawings.
- Each real drawing is a rectangular partitioned frame enclosing one or more background regions.

Rule:
- For each non-background color, reconstruct its horizontal and vertical wall segments from dense row/column evidence.
- Count the 4-connected background regions fully enclosed by those reconstructed walls.
- The color with no enclosed region is the noise/pad color.
- Sort drawing colors by enclosed-region count; equal counts are ordered by which reconstructed frame covers the other.

Key insight:
- The scattered color is not an object; it only pads the histogram, while each true object's room count is stable after rectilinear wall reconstruction.

Fill each black 5x5 region's missing interior positions with a fixed 3x3 positional color legend.

Input structure
- The grid uses teal as the dominant background and black for one or more
  5x5 regions.
- Each black region has a black one-pixel border and a 3x3 interior that
  may already contain teal pixels.

Rule
- Overlay the legend 1 7 6 / 4 8 5 / 2 9 3 on the 3x3 interior of every
  5x5 black region.
- Wherever an interior non-center legend position is still black, recolor it
  to the corresponding legend color; leave existing teal pixels, the center,
  and the black border unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored output pixels are not derived from the teal motif shape; they
  are the fixed position labels for the missing cells of each 3x3 interior.

Complete the sparse-color reflected copy of the foreground motif across its matching marker row or column.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and two foreground colors.
- One foreground color appears only as a sparse marker row or column.
- The other foreground color contains the same sparse marker positions on a parallel row or column, plus the motif on the far side of the sparse markers.

Rule
- Keep the original grid unchanged.
- Reflect every motif pixel of the larger foreground color across the two parallel marker lines.
- Paint the reflected motif pixels with the sparse marker color.

Key insight
- The two equal marker rows or columns are paired landmarks: the sparse-color marker line borders the source motif, and the matching source-color marker line anchors the reflected copy.

Erase the first border pixel hit by extending the red marker away from its pink trail.

Input structure
- The dominant background surrounds a unique red marker and a four-pixel
  pink trail.
- The pink pixels form one straight 8-connected ray starting next to the
  red marker.
- In the opposite direction from that trail, the red marker faces a
  non-background border or obstacle pixel beyond background cells.

Rule
- Keep the whole grid fixed except for the first non-background pixel on
  the ray from the red marker away from the pink trail.
- Recolor that one hit pixel to the background color.

Key insight
- The pink trail marks where the red marker came from, so the edit is found
  by ray-casting from the red marker in the opposite direction.

Fit a grey bar into a grey frame by aligning projections with colored columns, then stack colors above.

Input structure:
- bg, a grey structural color forming two components: a large rectangular frame (slot) and a smaller bar with upward projections.
- Colored pixels inside the slot mark target columns.

Rule:
- Move the bar upward into the slot so its bottom edge sits one cell above the slot's interior bottom.
- Shift it horizontally so the bar's upward projections align column-wise with the colored pixels in the slot.
- Stack the colored pixels immediately above the bar projections in each column.

Key insight: The bar's projections act as keys that must align with the colored-column "locks" in the slot.

Erase the complete interior glyph and expand each endpoint marker pair into its color's full glyph.

Input structure
- The grid is 20x20 with background inside two same-color full-height vertical frame bars.
- Inside the frame there is one complete color glyph and one or more other colors appearing only as two endpoint markers in the same row.
- Marker endpoints are always in the first and last interior columns.

Rule
- Keep the vertical frame unchanged.
- Erase any complete interior glyph.
- For each endpoint marker pair, use that marker color's learned glyph template and anchor its horizontal bar on the marker row.

Key insight
- Color identifies which glyph shape to draw; the two endpoint pixels are not copied objects, they are anchors for reconstructing that color's full symbol.

Simulate water falling from top-edge sources, pooling on shelves, and cascading off edges.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; water = rarest non-bg; shelf = other non-bg.
- Sources: water clusters touching top row. Shelves: horizontal segments.

Rule:
- Water falls down from sources, painting bg cells as water.
- On hitting a shelf, it spreads across the shelf span plus one cell past each end.
- From those overflow positions, water resumes falling independently.

Key insight: Each shelf splits a stream into two at its edges, creating a branching waterfall tree.

Complete partial paths inside a framed rectangle by projecting external color traces inward.

Input structure:
- bg, a 1px rectangular frame (border color) with uniform interior fill.
- Colored components outside the frame touching its edges.

Rule:
- Output = the frame's interior, filled with the fill color.
- Map each outside component's frame-touch points into interior coordinates.
- Monochrome components become solid Manhattan stripes between mapped endpoints.
- Two-color components become alternating-color Manhattan paths.

Key insight: Endpoint colors of two-color traces anchor the alternating phase deterministically.

Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Fill each plus-shaped background notch with the color of the frame side it opens toward.

Input structure
- A one-cell-thick rectangular frame has four solid-colored sides and neutral corner pixels.
- The frame interior contains a dominant background color and one foreground object color.
- Some object boundaries contain five-pixel plus-shaped background notches.

Rule
- Find every background plus whose opposite side is supported by foreground object pixels and whose open side faces one frame side.
- Recolor the five pixels of that plus with the color of the facing frame side.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
The frame side colors are direction labels for the open notches in the foreground object.

Swap every sprite to the opposite prototype while preserving scale and position.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Two distinct small sprite patterns (prototypes) appear at various scales.
- Each sprite instance is a scaled copy of one of the two prototypes, placed on the grid.

Rule:
- Identify the two prototype patterns from the smallest-area sprites.
- For each sprite, determine which prototype it matches and its integer scale factor.
- Replace it with the other prototype at the same scale, aligned by an internal anchor region (color-1 pixels).

Key insight: Every sprite toggles to the alternate prototype; the anchor sub-region inside each sprite pins the alignment so swapped sprites land in the correct position regardless of scale.

Complete a four-corner framed rectangle from one decorated anchor rectangle and its diagonal mate.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Two same-color solid rectangular anchors of the same size sit on opposite
  diagonal corners, with the first anchor above-left of the second.
- The upper-left anchor has two one-cell-thick vertical control bars to its
  right and two one-cell-thick horizontal control bars below it.

Rule:
- Copy the anchor rectangle into the two missing corners of the implied
  larger rectangle.
- Repeat the right-side control bars horizontally between the left and right
  anchors, using their spacing as the period, and draw the outer top and
  bottom borders in the first right-control color.
- Repeat the below-side control bars vertically between the top and bottom
  anchors, using the same period, and draw the outer left and right borders
  in the first below-control color.

Key insight: The small control bars are the first two ticks of two periodic
frame patterns; the diagonal anchor supplies the opposite corner and the
missing two anchor copies.

Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Swap a connector segment with repeated marker sprites by connecting the marker anchors and stamping the sprite at the segment endpoints.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors. One foreground color forms a single straight 8-connected segment. The other foreground color forms two or more identical centered sprites.

Rule
Build a background canvas of the same size. Draw straight connector-color segments between every pair of original sprite anchors. Then stamp the marker sprite, using its centered anchor, onto the two endpoints of the original connector segment.

Key insight
The original segment endpoints are the destinations for the repeated sprite, while the original sprite centers become the vertices of the new connector-color complete graph.

Thicken the sparse frame and stamp the external sparse sprites into it in positional order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a regular lattice color, one large
sparse rectangular frame, and one or more external monochrome sprites whose
pixels also sit on a two-step lattice.

Rule
Use the largest sparse rectangular perimeter as the frame. Clear that frame
region and the external sprite pixels to background, draw a solid one-pixel
border in the frame color, solidify each sparse sprite into its contiguous
two-step mask, and place the sprites inside the frame with equal gaps.
Wide frames receive sprites left-to-right by source position; tall frames
receive them top-to-bottom by source position.

Key insight
The frame supplies ordered slots: the sprite-to-slot assignment is by visible
source order, not by numeric color or by matching individual cells.

Emit diagonal beams from framed 2x2 blocks through frame gaps; beams interact on collision.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall color (e.g. green) forms 4x4 frames around 2x2 monochrome blocks.
- Each frame has one or more gap pixels where the wall is missing.

Rule:
- Each gap emits a beam of the inner block's color, traveling diagonally outward (direction set by gap position relative to the block).
- Beams paint every cell they cross until they hit the grid edge or collide.
- 90° collision: both beams turn 45° toward their bisector direction; the intersection cell is left blank (1-pixel gap).
- 45° collision: beams merge into a zigzag (alternating cardinal + diagonal steps) with no gap at the meeting point.

Key insight: Two distinct collision rules — 90° produces a gap and single-pixel diagonal lines; 45° produces no gap and thicker zigzag bands.

Fill holes inside a large template frame using shape-matched outside sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. One large monochrome frame object (template).
- Inside the frame: holes of various shapes (non-frame-color regions).
- Outside the frame: small monochrome sprites scattered on bg.

Rule:
- Crop to the frame's bounding box; fill entirely with frame color.
- For each hole, find an outside sprite whose shape matches (rotation/flip allowed).
- Fill the hole with the matched sprite's color. If multiple sprites match, use the most frequent color.

Key insight: Sprites act as shape-coded color keys — their shape identifies which hole they fill, their color determines the fill color.

Fill each vertical foreground band's background cells with the color of the next band to its right.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each other color occupies a separate vertical band defined by that color's
  minimum and maximum columns.
- Within a band, all cells are either that band's color or background.

Rule
- Order the bands from left to right.
- In each band, replace background pixels with the color of the next band in
  that order, wrapping from the rightmost band back to the leftmost.
- Preserve all existing foreground pixels and all background pixels outside
  the bands.

Key insight
- The column bands form a cyclic palette legend: a band's gaps are completed
  by borrowing the color from its right-hand neighbor, not by changing the
  band's existing pixels.

Recolor the two diagonal foreground-bar orientations, assigning teal to the larger orientation and red to the smaller one.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground color.
- Foreground pixels form one-cell-thick diagonal bars.
- Every foreground pixel belongs to exactly one diagonal orientation.

Rule
- Keep the background unchanged.
- Classify each foreground pixel by whether it has a diagonal neighbor on the NW/SE axis or the NE/SW axis.
- Recolor the orientation with more foreground pixels teal and the other orientation red.

Key insight
- The output colors depend on the relative population of the two diagonal orientations, not on a fixed slash direction or position.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
