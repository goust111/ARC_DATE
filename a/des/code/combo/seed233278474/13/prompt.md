Erase the two leftmost columns of every foreground object, leaving the rest of each object in place.

Input structure:
- A grid has one dominant background color and several monochromatic 4-connected foreground objects.
- Each foreground object spans at least two columns in its bounding box.

Rule:
- Find each same-color 4-connected foreground object.
- Within each object's own bounding box, set foreground pixels in the two leftmost columns to the background color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The deletion is measured from each object's local left edge, not from the grid edge or from a shared global column.

Extract the compact table of solid cells hidden inside a separator lattice.

Input structure
- The grid has full-width and full-height bars of one separator color, dividing it into rectangular cells.
- Most cells contain a repeating multicolor pattern, while a contiguous rectangle of cells is solid monochrome.

Rule
- Split the input into lattice cells using the full separator rows and columns.
- Keep the cells whose full interior is one color, crop to their occupied rectangle, and output those colors.

Key insight
- The periodic pattern is noise; only completely solid lattice cells encode the reduced output grid.

Shift alternating two-color row bars so each row aligns to the topmost bar's color columns.

Input structure:
- The dominant background surrounds horizontal two-pixel bars.
- Every foreground row has exactly one adjacent bar using the same two colors.
- The topmost bar gives the reference left/right column for each color.

Rule:
- Keep bars whose left color is already in its reference column.
- For a reversed bar, shift the whole two-pixel bar horizontally until its
  left color lands in that color's reference column.
- Background cells vacated by shifted bars become background.

Key insight:
- The rows are not recolored; each two-color bar is translated so equal
  colors line up with the topmost reference bar.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

Move the left-edge fragment into its same-colored anchor fragment to complete a solid rectangle.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Exactly one foreground color is split into two 4-connected objects: one
  touches the left edge, and the other is an anchor away from the left edge.
- The translated left-edge object and the anchor can form one filled rectangle.
Rule
- Find the unique split color whose left-edge object can be translated onto
  background cells beside the other same-colored object so their union is a
  solid axis-aligned rectangle.
- Clear the left-edge object's original cells to the background.
- Paint that object at the unique completing offset, preserving all other cells.
Key insight
- The active color is identified by object structure and rectangle completion,
  not by a fixed color id; the same-colored anchor object stays in place.

<description>
Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Assemble scattered jigsaw sprites around a central yellow anchor by pairing red connector pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = black (0). Several colored sprites scattered on the grid.
- One anchor sprite contains a 3×3 yellow (4) block.
- Each sprite has red (2) connector pixels along its edges.

Rule:
- The anchor stays in place; remaining sprites attach one at a time.
- Each sprite is translated so that one of its red pixels overlaps an unpaired red pixel on the growing assembly.
- Every red connector must pair with exactly one other, forming a complete joined structure.

Key insight: Red pixels act as jigsaw pegs — each must match exactly one counterpart, and the assembly order is determined by which unpaired connectors remain.

Predict the next panel in a framed sequence by continuing each scheduled colored interval.

Input structure
- The grid is made from three or more equal panels in one row or one column.
- The final input panel is the static target template; every earlier panel differs from it only by dynamic colors absent from the template.
- Each dynamic color appears in a regular temporal schedule across the earlier panels.

Rule
- Keep the final template panel as the output canvas.
- For every dynamic color whose schedule reaches the next panel, compare its last two appearances.
- Extrapolate each one-dimensional interval along the color's changing row or column axis and paint that predicted mask.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for the last visible panel, but for the next frame after the blank/template slot.

Repeat each 3x3 control-center sprite toward the matching solid rectangle until a copy first overlaps that rectangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each sprite is a 3x3 foreground object whose eight border pixels have one color and whose center has a different control color.
- For every control color, there is exactly one separate solid rectangular object of that color.

Rule
- Match each sprite to the unique solid rectangle whose color equals the sprite center.
- Copy the whole 3x3 sprite in the cardinal direction of that rectangle, stepping by three cells each time.
- Stop after pasting the first copy whose 3x3 bbox overlaps the rectangle; copied pixels overwrite the rectangle there.

Key insight
The center pixel is not the paint color: it is a destination key, while the entire 3x3 sprite is the motif tiled along the straight path.

Within each horizontal pair of two-color panels, swap the motif masks and recolor each pasted mask with the source panel's base color.

Input structure:
- A separator color forms full blank rows and at least one full blank column.
- The non-separator area is split into row bands, each containing exactly two same-shaped rectangular panels.
- Each panel has a dominant base color and one minority motif color.

Rule:
- For every row band, clear each panel to its own base color.
- Paste the right panel's motif mask into the left panel using the right base color.
- Paste the left panel's motif mask into the right panel using the left base color.

Key insight:
- The motif colors themselves are distractors; only each motif's shape mask and the two panel base colors are exchanged.

Expand each colored control pixel into its corresponding fixed 4x4 glyph.

Input structure:
- Black background with single-pixel markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and/or 8.
- Some inputs also show a sample 4x4 glyph in the output color, with a same-rule marker just below-right of the sample.

Rule:
- Replace each marker color by its learned 4x4 glyph: 2->yellow frame, 3->blue ring, 5->pink diagonal blocks, 8->orange X.
- Paint each glyph with its top-left corner at the marker pixel, clipping at the grid boundary.
- Remove the sample glyphs and skip their below-right label markers.

Key insight:
- The colored pixels are control pixels for a fixed glyph alphabet; non-control sample glyphs are only legend entries, not preserved scene objects.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Move colored sprites from the left strip into a framed area at marker-defined targets.

Input structure:
- bg background; rectangular frame on right with colored markers on its edges; sprites in a narrow left strip separated by a constant-color divider column.

Rule:
- For each color, target rows/cols are where both opposite frame edges share that color. Targets are the Cartesian product.
- Erase each sprite from the left and stamp it centered at every target. Higher sprites cover lower ones.

Key insight: One sprite replicates to a grid of row × column marker intersections.

Assemble scattered rectangular pieces into a rectangle at an L-marker corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg rectangular pieces scattered on the grid.
- 3-pixel L-marker (2x2 minus one cell) tags the corner; the gap is the corner cell.

Rule:
- rect_col = most common color across all piece pixels; all outer rectangle edges must be rect_col.
- Translate pieces (no rotation) to tile the rectangle; touching edges must match, with rect_col as wildcard.

Key insight: rect_col acts as wildcard during edge matching — only non-rect_col pixels at shared boundaries must agree.

Move each isolated colored pixel into the one-cell frame around a grey 2x2 block.

Input structure:
- Background is the dominant color.
- Grey foreground objects are solid 2x2 anchor blocks.
- Every other non-background, non-grey cell is a colored singleton source.

Rule:
- Keep the grey anchors fixed and clear all colored singleton source pixels.
- For each singleton and each anchor, the normal destination is the cell reached by
  clamping the pixel into the anchor's one-cell outer frame.
- If a diagonally outside singleton has an exact 8-direction sightline into an anchor,
  also allow the cell just before the first grey pixel on that ray.
- Choose distinct destinations that minimize total king-move distance; at equal
  distance prefer exact sightlines, then the shorter Manhattan movement.

Key insight: The grey 2x2 blocks define magnetic frames; conflicts are resolved
structurally by nearest-frame assignment rather than by color identity.

Mirror the smallest non-axis foreground color across the full straight axis.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color forms exactly one full row, column, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal reflection axis.
- The remaining foreground colors include a unique least-populated color to copy.

Rule
- Preserve the input grid.
- Select every pixel of the unique smallest non-axis foreground color.
- Reflect those pixels across the full straight axis and paint the reflected positions with the same color.

Key insight
- The axis color marks the mirror line, while the color population chooses which set of objects is duplicated.

Simulate tokens falling through a pipe network after gates rotate open.

Input structure:
- Wall (0), bg (pipe fill), gate (horizontal 1×3 bars), token (small edge pixels).

Rule:
- Rotate each gate into a vertical blocker; gate cells become bg.
- Tokens drop downward through bg, choosing the extreme column for their side (left→min, right→max).
- Tokens settle at true pipe ends (adjacent to wall/boundary), packing inward.

Key insight: Tokens select drop columns by entry side and land at wall-bounded endpoints, ignoring blocker-bounded ones.

Mark each arrow-like sprite's pointed frame endpoint with its color and the opposite endpoint black.

Input structure:
- The grid has a one-pixel solid rectangular frame around a dominant interior background.
- Inside the frame are monochrome six-pixel sprites shaped as asymmetric T arrows.
- Each sprite has a length-4 bar and a length-3 crossbar one cell closer to the pointed end.

Rule:
- For each sprite, follow its bar axis from the shorter end to the frame.
- Paint that frame endpoint with the sprite color.
- Paint the opposite endpoint on the same row or column black.
- Leave the interior background, sprites, and all other frame pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The direction is encoded by the crossbar's off-center position: the nearer end is the pointing end.

Recolor every pixel whose color is not one of the two most frequent input colors to orange.

Input structure:
- The grid contains at least three colors.
- Orange is absent from the input and is used only as the output replacement color.
- Exactly two colors occupy the top two frequency ranks; they may tie with each
  other, but no third color ties them at the cutoff.

Rule:
- Preserve every pixel whose color is one of the two most frequent input colors.
- Replace every other pixel with orange.

Key insight:
- The visible distinction is not the numeric identity of the colors but their
  population: the two majority colors remain, while all minority colors merge
  into the new orange color.

Move each maroon marker toward the blue rectangle and recolor the rectangle red.

Input structure
A background canvas contains one solid blue rectangular object and several isolated
maroon marker pixels. Each marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the
rectangle and lies outside it.

Rule
Start with a background canvas, repaint the blue rectangle red, and move each
maroon marker straight toward the rectangle along its row or column. Exactly one
marker is strictly closer to the rectangle than all others and enters the
rectangle boundary; every other marker lands in the adjacent exterior cell just
outside its aligned side.

Key insight
The single entering marker is the unique global nearest marker to the rectangle,
not the nearest marker on each of the four sides.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
