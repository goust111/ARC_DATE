Render the filled-square object counts as compact nested stacks ordered by count rank.

Input structure
A large noisy grid has a dominant background, scattered non-square noise, and
filled monochrome square objects. Each square side length has exactly one
object color, and side lengths form consecutive sizes.

Rule
Ignore non-square components. If the lowest square in the scene is of the
smallest side length, treat that one smallest square as a distractor and do
not count it. For count rank k from left to right, create one block from all
square sizes with at least k remaining objects; draw larger squares first and
smaller squares over their upper-left corner, then append one background
separator column.

Key insight
The output is a count histogram of square side lengths, but each histogram
slot is rendered as nested upper-left square masks using the side colors.

Replace each marker below the separator with the mapped top legend square centered on that marker.

Input structure:
- The background surrounds a top legend, one solid non-background separator row, and a lower marker field.
- The legend contains equal-size filled square sprites, with a singleton marker below each sprite and aligned to its center column.
- The lower field contains only background and marker colors from the legend.

Rule:
- Pair legend markers to legend sprites by left-to-right position.
- Discard the legend and separator; keep the grid width and the rows below the separator.
- In the lower field, replace every marker pixel by a filled square of the paired sprite color, centered at the marker location.

Key insight: The top area is a positional color legend, and the actual output is the post-separator marker field expanded by that legend.

Replace a corner L with a same-color right-triangle outline in the corresponding corner of an enlarged canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a square grid with one background color and one foreground color.
- The foreground is a one-pixel-thick L inside a square bbox.
- The L touches exactly one horizontal grid edge and one vertical grid edge, identifying a corner.

Rule:
- Fill a square output canvas of side 3n-2, where n is the input side length, with the background color.
- Double the L leg length to get the triangle side length.
- Draw the two perpendicular triangle legs on the same output corner edges and connect their free endpoints with the diagonal.

Key insight:
- The input L encodes the corner, color, and side length of the triangle outline; the missing side is the diagonal between the L's two free endpoints.

<description>
Complete each boundary tab or notch by adding the complementary feature on the opposite side of the foreground object.

Input structure
- The grid has exactly two colors: a dominant background and one foreground object.
- The foreground object is a thick rectilinear shape with one-pixel tabs and notches on its boundary.

Rule
- A foreground tab is a one-neighbor boundary pixel; project through its full row or column span and remove the opposite edge pixel to make a matching notch.
- A background notch is a one-pixel cut with three foreground 4-neighbors; project across the full row or column span and add a tab just outside the opposite edge.
- Notches immediately beside a tab source are not independent sources, because that gap belongs to the tab's local boundary shape.

Key insight
- The changed pixels are not color-specific noise; they are paired jigsaw-like boundary features on opposite sides of the same thick row or column cross-section.

Repair markers embedded in the main object and copy the remaining markers one pixel toward the solid edge.

Input structure:
- A mostly background grid contains one solid non-background edge line.
- Apart from that edge and the background, there is one large main object
  color and a smaller marker color.
- Each marker is either embedded in the main object, touching it on at
  least three 4-neighbor sides, or isolated on the background.

Rule:
- Embedded markers are recolored to the main object color.
- Isolated background markers remain in place and also paint the adjacent
  background pixel in the direction of the solid edge line.
- All other pixels are unchanged.

Key insight:
The full edge line is a direction cue: it tells which way the background
markers extend, while markers surrounded by the main object are simply
defects to be filled.

Fold each straight red rod at its black marker, leaving the gray-anchored side fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground object is a straight horizontal or vertical 4-connected rod.
- Each rod contains many pixels of one line color, one endpoint marker, and one
  interior control marker.

Rule:
- For every rod, keep the segment from the endpoint marker through the control
  marker unchanged.
- Move the line-color tail on the far side of the control marker to a
  perpendicular ray starting next to that marker.
- Choose the perpendicular direction with more space to the grid edge.

Key insight:
- The endpoint marker identifies the fixed side of the rod, while the control
  marker is the hinge; the tail folds into the larger open half-plane.

Project the framed periodic stripe pattern across the canvas and erase the unused frame cells.

Input structure
- A bg canvas with a one-cell-thick rectangular frame of one color.
- Inside the frame are two parallel full-interior marker bars of another color.
- A third color fills the region between the marker bars on periodically spaced rows or columns.

Rule
- Infer the periodic row or column mask from the third-color stripes inside the frame.
- Paint the frame color along those full rows or columns, extended to the grid boundary.
- Extend the marker bars across the full canvas and repaint the source-color stripe cells between them.

Key insight
- The outer frame is not preserved as a border; it supplies the color for the periodic stripes selected by the inner source pattern.

<description>
Keep the largest 8-connected motif and replace the corner/control pixels with a solid corner triangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Exactly one grid corner contains a foreground control pixel; it gives the
  corner from which the triangle is painted.
- There is one unique largest 8-connected monochrome foreground object, the
  motif that remains in the output; all other foreground pixels are controls.
- Every foreground component outside that motif is a singleton control pixel.
- The fill color is the unique control color that appears in at least two
  non-corner control pixels.

Rule
- Start from a blank background canvas and redraw only the largest motif.
- Count the non-corner control pixels; that count is the triangle side.
- Paint the fill color on the right-triangle region where those two distances
  from the marked corner's edges sum to less than the side length.

Key insight
- The scattered singleton controls are counted into a compact triangular
  stack at the marked corner; only the largest motif is not part of the count.

Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Slide each foreground object horizontally to the edge indicated by whether its shape has an open notch.

Input structure:
- Yellow is the background and there is one blue foreground color.
- The foreground is split into separated 4-connected objects.
- Each object keeps its row span and shape in the output.

Rule:
- If an object's bbox border contains a background gap flanked by object pixels along that same border, slide it to the right edge and recolor it green.
- Otherwise slide the object to the left edge and recolor it red.
- Start from a blank background canvas; no moved objects overlap.

Key insight:
- The target side is encoded by the object's shape, not by its original position: open notches go right, while closed or solid shapes go left.

Use the pink control pixel to choose where the maroon pixel belongs inside the grey 3x3 region, and turn the control pixel maroon.

Input structure:
- The grid contains one 3x3 region made from eight grey pixels and one maroon pixel.
- There is exactly one pink control pixel outside that region.

Rule:
- Restore the old maroon cell in the 3x3 region to grey.
- Compare the pink pixel to the 3x3 region: above/same band/below selects top/middle/bottom, and left/same band/right selects left/middle/right.
- Paint the selected cell maroon and recolor the pink control pixel maroon.

Key insight:
- The pink pixel acts as a relative-position marker for a 3x3 target inside the grey region.

Cut a sprite along border-control rays and slide pieces to grid corners.

Input structure:
- bg, fg (main object, ~centered), ctrl (1-2 pixels on grid edges).

Rule:
- Draw rays inward from each ctrl pixel along its row/col, painting only bg cells up to the farthest fg pixel (intermittent).
- Rays partition the grid; fg on the cut line stays in place.
- Cut pieces in regions touching a control edge slide to that corner; others vanish.

Key insight: Only regions sharing a border edge with a control pixel keep their piece; the ray skips fg cells.

Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

Erase all distractor pixels and expand the single red control pixel into the grid quadrant that contains it.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Exactly one red pixel is the control pixel.
- Other non-background pixels are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Split the grid into equal top/bottom and left/right halves.
- Fill the quadrant containing the red control pixel with red.

Key insight:
- The red control pixel selects a whole half-grid quadrant by its row half and column half; all other foreground pixels are noise.

Normalize vertical two-color bars between paired marker columns around the marker rows.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- A row of red marker pixels sits directly above a row of gray marker pixels
  in the same alternating columns.
- The columns between adjacent markers contain vertical bars made from a
  contiguous teal run above a contiguous blue run.

Rule
- Keep the marker pixels and all non-bar background cells fixed.
- Let h be the maximum teal-run height among the bar columns; paint teal in
  every bar column for h rows ending at the red marker row.
- In each bar column, move its blue run to start at the gray marker row and
  fill all lower cells in that column with maroon.

Key insight
- The marker rows are a baseline: teal is normalized into a common upper
  band, while each blue run keeps its own height below the baseline.

Add a quantity-color label in the top marker column for each horizontal bar.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background and one non-background marker pixel in the top row.
- Below the marker row, every non-empty source row contains one solid monochrome horizontal bar to the left of the marker column.
- Source rows are staggered every other row.

Rule
- Copy the input grid.
- For each source bar, read its quantity as the bar length.
- Paint the quantity color in the marker column on the same row as the bar:
  2->1, 3->4, 4->9, 5->6.

Key insight
- The grey marker supplies the result column, while each bar supplies a small quantity with a fixed color code.

Move each source pixel toward the separator when it matches its aligned reference pixel, otherwise to the far edge.

Input structure:
- A single full separator line is part of a rectangular frame; the frame's
  extra cells mark the reference side.
- On the reference side, one row or column of colored pixels is aligned
  with one row or column of source pixels on the opposite side.
- Each side has its own dominant background color.

Rule:
- Compare each source pixel with the reference pixel on the same row or column.
- If their colors match, place the source pixel in the cell adjacent to the
  separator on the source side.
- If their colors differ, place the source pixel on the far outer edge along
  the same row or column.
- Erase the original source pixels to the source-side background; keep the
  frame and reference pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The extra frame cells identify which side is the reference; equality with the
aligned reference pixel decides whether each source pixel moves inward or outward.

Pack the colored sprites along the bottom edge from smallest to largest.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and several monochrome 4-connected
foreground sprites; a full-grid one-cell frame may surround the scene.

Rule
Remove any full-grid rectangular frame, sort the remaining sprites by pixel
area from smallest to largest, and paste their bounding-box sprites left to
right with each sprite bottom-aligned.

Key insight
The original locations do not determine the final slots; each sprite's area
gives the packing order, while its shape and color are preserved.

Recolor the grey diagonal-chain regions in an orange field to teal.

Input structure
The input contains only grey pixels and orange pixels.  Grey pixels form
several 8-connected regions embedded in the orange field.

Rule
Decompose each grey 8-connected region into 4-connected lobes.  Recolor the
whole region teal only when it contains a straight diagonal run of at least
three pixels and those lobes meet only by diagonal corner contacts in a
non-branching diagonal chain or cycle; a single 4-connected region is
recolored only when it is a square diagonal staircase.

Key insight
The teal regions are not selected by size or position; they are the grey
regions whose internal connectivity depends on diagonal corner joins, while
same-edge cracks, rectangles, bars, and branching/noisy regions remain grey.

Shear the rectangular input down-left onto a black canvas.

Input structure
A rectangular grid of colored pixels with no internal empty region to infer.

Rule
Create a black output with the same height and width W + H - 1, then copy
each input row r unchanged starting at column H - 1 - r.

Key insight
The colors and row contents are preserved; only the row offsets change so
the left edge forms a descending diagonal.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取一道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、高精度方向区分（>4 方向，如时钟 12 方向）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。例如：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
