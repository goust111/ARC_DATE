Predict the next panel in a framed sequence by continuing each scheduled colored interval.

Input structure
- The grid is made from three or more equal panels in one row or one column.
- The final input panel is the static target template; every earlier panel differs from it only by dynamic colors absent from the template.
- Each dynamic color appears in a regular temporal schedule across the earlier panels.

Rule
- Keep the final template panel as the output canvas.
- For every dynamic color whose schedule reaches the next panel, compare its last two appearances.
- Extrapolate each one-dimensional interval along the color's changing row or column axis and paint that predicted mask.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for the last visible panel, but for the next frame after the blank/template slot.

Extend the edge-touching green start bar through the corridor, turning at each teal blocker until the path leaves the grid.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: a 2-pixel 4-connected start bar and many blocker pixels.
- Exactly one pixel of the start bar lies on the grid border.

Rule:
- Start from the border pixel of the bar and move through the other bar pixel into the grid.
- Paint every traversed non-blocker pixel with the start color.
- When the next cell is a blocker, turn to the unique perpendicular non-blocker neighbor; when the next cell is outside the grid, stop.

Key insight: The blocker pixels define a one-cell-wide corridor, so every interior collision has exactly one valid 90-degree turn.

Copy the unique colored sprite tile into every tiled cell marked by an internal separator-colored pixel.

Input structure
- Full same-color separator rows and columns partition the grid into equal rectangular tiles.
- One tile contains the only non-background, non-separator colored sprite.
- Target tiles are otherwise background-colored but contain at least one internal pixel of the separator color.

Rule
- Keep the separator lines and the source sprite tile unchanged.
- Replace each marked target tile with an exact copy of the source tile.
- Unmarked background-only tiles remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The internal separator-colored pixels are placement markers; the single colored tile is the template to stamp into those marked cells.

Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Slide a solid square through a winding channel to reach a same-sized target square.

Input structure:
- bg (most common color). A river color forms a winding corridor.
- Two same-sized NxN solid squares on the river: mover and destination, each a distinct color.

Rule:
- The mover square travels along the river toward the destination.
- It can only pass through positions where the full NxN area is river.
- If reachable, the mover replaces the destination; otherwise it stops at the farthest reachable point.
- The mover's original position is filled with the river color.

Key insight: Chokepoints narrower than N pixels block the square, forcing it to stop short.

<description>
Assemble colored rectangular sprites into a single tiled rectangle, anchored by a marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Several solid-colored rectangular sprites scattered on the grid.
- One sprite has a unique single-pixel marker (different color) at one corner — this is the anchor.

Rule:
- Identify the anchor sprite (contains the marker pixel) and the remaining pieces.
- Rotate the anchor so the marker pixel lands at position (0,0) of the output.
- Pack all remaining pieces (allowing 90° rotations) to tile a complete rectangle with no gaps.

Key insight: The lone marker pixel picks the anchor and fixes the output orientation — it must sit at the top-left corner.

Extract the lattice subregion bounded by the four background-colored corner holes.

Input structure:
- A regular one-cell-thick lattice has one line color, one background color,
  and sparse marker pixels.
- Exactly four lattice-line intersections are background-colored holes instead
  of line-color pixels.

Rule:
- Find the unique non-background color that forms regular horizontal and
  vertical lattice lines.
- Use the four background-colored lattice intersections as the corners of one
  rectangle.
- Return the inclusive crop between those corner rows and columns.

Key insight:
- The crop is marked by the missing lattice intersections, not by the marker
  pixels inside the cells.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Grow four clockwise spiral wall paths from the tips of a teal cross.

Input structure:
- bg = 0 (black). A single teal (8) cross centered in the grid.

Rule:
- Each arm tip launches a "turtle" heading 90° right of its outward direction.
- Movement priority: turn right > go straight > turn left (left only if not on border).
- Normal step = 2 cells; step right after a turn = 1 cell.
- Each new cell must have a 1-cell orthogonal gap from all existing walls except the predecessor.

Key insight: The right-turn preference plus alternating 2/1 step lengths creates self-avoiding spirals that tile the grid with uniform spacing.

Replace the active black cutout's tail with background and mark the cutout side facing a colored source region.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background, with black rectangle-plus-tail cutouts, one gray source region, and colored distractors.
- Non-gray colored regions and single pixels are distractors/blockers, even when they are multi-pixel staircase shapes.

Rule:
- Find each black cutout whose largest solid rectangle leaves exactly a two-pixel tail.
- The active gray source region is visible only by horizontal rays through background from a cutout's left or right side.
- Select the unique cutout side with the most same-source visible rows, erase that cutout's tail to background, and recolor the full selected vertical side pink (6).

Key insight:
- The colored regions do not move; their horizontal line-of-sight identifies which rectangular cutout is being opened and which side receives the pink mark.

Fill the small background compartments bounded by the long contour color.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and two foreground colors.
- The more frequent foreground color forms long 8-connected contour fragments.
- The other foreground color is a fixed distractor/obstacle color that partitions
  the background but is never recolored.

Rule:
- Split the background into 4-connected regions using all foreground pixels as
  barriers.
- Keep the two largest background regions as the outside of the contour drawing.
- Recolor every other background region that touches a long contour component
  to the contour color; leave all foreground pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The apparent area fill is exactly a component-level fill of bounded background
compartments, not a row-wise interpolation between individual contour pixels.

Extract the central object from the marker cluster whose markers have the same color.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background and several clusters; each cluster has four
same-color corner marker objects around one central monochromatic object.
Rule
Find every central object enclosed by four aligned corner markers of one color,
then choose the unique one whose object color equals the marker color.
Key insight
The answer is not the largest or most frequent object; it is the center of the
self-colored cluster, cropped to that object's bounding box with background kept.

Move each gray bar into its adjacent orange rectangle as full stripes from the contacted edge.

Input structure
- The scene uses black outside space, yellow fill, gray one-cell-thick bars, and solid orange rectangles.
- Each gray bar 4-touches exactly one orange rectangle; some orange rectangles have no touching gray bar.
- Gray bars touching the same orange rectangle all have the same orientation.

Rule
- Recolor every original gray cell to yellow.
- For each orange rectangle touched by gray bars, count the gray cells assigned to that rectangle.
- Horizontal gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange rows starting from the contacted top or bottom row.
- Vertical gray bars repaint that many cells as complete orange columns starting from the contacted left or right column.
- Orange rectangles with no touching gray bar remain unchanged.

Key insight
- The gray pixels are not copied by shape; their count is transferred into the neighboring orange rectangle as edge-aligned row or column stripes.

Expand the sparse dot lattice into a 26x26 drawing with thick bars between adjacent matching dots.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground pixels lie on logical rows and columns separated by background spacer rows/columns.
- A logical row or column is present when it contains at least one foreground pixel.

Rule
- Expand every background spacer row/column to thickness 2.
- Expand the logical rows/columns equally so the full output is 26x26.
- Paint each foreground logical pixel as a solid rectangle of its color.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels horizontally through the intervening spacer.
- Connect adjacent same-color logical pixels vertically only when neither endpoint is part of a horizontal same-color run.

Key insight
- The input is a sampled line drawing: horizontal same-color runs define the bars first, and only unclaimed same-color vertical neighbors are joined.

Recolor every pixel whose color is not one of the two most frequent input colors to orange.

Input structure:
- The grid contains at least three colors.
- Orange is absent from the input and is used only as the output replacement color.
- Exactly two colors occupy the top two frequency ranks; they may tie with each
  other, but no third color ties them at the cutoff.

Rule:
- Preserve every pixel whose color is one of the two most frequent input colors.
- Replace every other pixel with orange.

Key insight:
- The visible distinction is not the numeric identity of the colors but their
  population: the two majority colors remain, while all minority colors merge
  into the new orange color.

Slide yellow pixels inside walled regions in the direction dictated by border-legend arrows.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; yellow pixels sit inside enclosed regions bounded by colored walls.
- Border legends: small rectangles on the grid edge whose fill color C matches a region's border color. Each legend contains a center dot and an indicator dot encoding a direction.

Rule:
- For each enclosed region, identify its border color C and look up the legend with fill color C.
- The direction from the legend's center dot to its indicator dot gives the slide direction.
- All yellow pixels in that region slide in that direction, stacking against the far wall.

Key insight: Legend fill color links to region border color; the center→indicator offset encodes the movement vector.

Extract the unique cell from each lattice row into a single-column lattice.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into equal square cells by uniform gridlines of color L.
- Cell interiors filled with bg; each cell has an inner sprite pattern.
- Each row of cells has exactly one cell with a unique pattern; the rest are copies.

Rule:
- For each lattice row, find the cell whose inner pattern appears exactly once (the "odd one out").
- Construct a single-column lattice preserving the original row heights, containing only the unique cells.

Key insight: The task is per-row "odd one out" — every cell in a row is identical except one oddball, which must be extracted.

Shift each row's dominant middle-color run left until its right edge aligns with the leftmost original right edge, moving displaced left-side pixels after the run.

Input structure:
- The grid has three colors.
- The most common color forms one contiguous horizontal run in every row.
- Pixels before those runs share one side color, and pixels after those runs share the other side color.

Rule:
- Find the minimum right edge column among the middle-color runs.
- In each row, keep the run width and the trailing right-side color count.
- Place the middle-color run so its right edge is at that minimum column, unless the run is too wide, in which case start it at column 0.
- Fill any remaining non-trailing cells with the left-side color.

Key insight:
The varying row prefixes are movable padding; the stable feature is the leftmost right boundary of the middle-color shape.

Keep the larger sprite from each separated panel and overlay those sprites into one 5x5 canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a 5x17 grid: three 5x5 panels separated by one-cell black columns.
- Each panel has the same background color and exactly one foreground color split into two 4-connected components.

Rule:
- In each panel, discard the smaller foreground component and keep the unique largest component as the sprite.
- Process panels left to right, placing each sprite at its panel coordinates on a 5x5 background canvas.
- If a sprite would cover an already placed sprite, slide it by the unique nearest in-bounds offset that avoids overlap.

Key insight:
- The extra same-colored component in each panel is a distractor; the final answer is the non-overlapping overlay of the three largest components.

Repack each non-background color group as a solid square ordered by increasing size.

Input structure
The grid has one dominant background color, and each other color has a
perfect-square pixel count. Those square side lengths are unique.

Rule
Convert every non-background color into a filled square whose side length is
the square root of its pixel count. Place the squares from left to right in
increasing side length, bottom-aligned, with one background column between
neighboring squares.

Key insight
The original geometry of each color is discarded; only the color's total
pixel count determines the size of its packed output square.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
