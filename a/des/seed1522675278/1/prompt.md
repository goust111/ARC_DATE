Compress the L-shaped cue to three rows and add a pink copy of the top-row foreground mask.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color, a two-color top row, and all
foreground pixels below the top row lie in the first column as vertical markers.

Rule
Keep the input top row as output row 0 and the first marker row as output row 1.
Output row 2 is background except at the top-row foreground columns, which are
recolored pink.

Key insight
The lower repeated marker rows only identify the vertical cue; the generated
row is a recolored mask of the horizontal cue in the top row.

Repaint regions from T-shaped control markers, erase the markers, and optionally rotate based on a color-9 L-marker.

Input structure:
- The grid is a mosaic of monochrome regions.
- Color 1 forms T-shaped control markers on region boundaries.
- Some controls use three singleton color-1 pixels around a colored center; that center is a literal replacement color.
- An optional 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker triggers 90-degree rotation of the output.

Rule:
- For a color-1 T marker, the single stem points at the destination region to repaint.
- The two diagonal cells behind the stem identify the source region; the destination gets that source region's original color.
- For a colored-center T marker, the same stem identifies the destination, but the center color is the replacement.
- All marker cells are filled with the final color of the source-side region.
- A 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker controls rotation: ┐ (corner top-right) → CCW 90°, ┌ (corner top-left) → CW 90°.

Key insight:
- The stem chooses what changes, while the two diagonals behind the stem choose where the marker itself belongs.

Extrapolate the moving sprite from a horizontal sequence of shared-border frames into the next standalone frame.

Input structure
- The grid is a row of equal-width framed panels sharing their vertical border columns.
- Each panel has the same fill color and one identical interior sprite at the same local columns.
- The sprite's top row changes by a constant amount from panel to panel.

Rule
- Build one output panel with the same height, frame color, fill color, and sprite.
- Continue the sprite's diagonal motion one more panel to the right.
- Because the output is a standalone panel, advance by the full panel width, not the shared-border spacing.

Key insight
- The panels are consecutive frames of motion; the output is the next frame after the sequence.

<description>
Summarize the enclosed table slots by the single object color inside each slot, using the slot background color for empty slots.

Input structure
- The most common color forms the outer background and all enclosed slot
  backgrounds.
- The enclosed background components form a complete rectangular array of
  slots, ordered by their positions.
- Each slot contains either no other color or exactly one object color.

Rule
- Find all 4-connected components of the most common color that do not touch
  the input edge.
- Sort their bounding boxes into row and column order to define the output
  table.
- For each slot, output its unique non-background color if present; otherwise
  output the background color.

Key insight
- The large grid is an expanded table: the enclosed background components are
  the cells, and any colored object drawn inside a cell is that cell's summary
  value.

Erase all distractor pixels and expand the single red control pixel into the grid quadrant that contains it.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Exactly one red pixel is the control pixel.
- Other non-background pixels are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Split the grid into equal top/bottom and left/right halves.
- Fill the quadrant containing the red control pixel with red.

Key insight:
- The red control pixel selects a whole half-grid quadrant by its row half and column half; all other foreground pixels are noise.

Slide each inner colored object horizontally into the same-colored vertical wall until it touches an obstacle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are two non-background colors.
- One foreground color fills the left column and the other fills the right column.
- Extra 8-connected objects of each wall color appear away from that color's wall.

Rule
- Clear the extra objects from their original positions.
- For each wall color, process its 8-connected extra objects from nearest to farthest from the matching wall.
- Slide each object horizontally toward its matching wall as far as possible without overlapping the wall or an already settled object of the same color.
- Keep the two vertical wall columns fixed.

Key insight
- The side columns act like color-specific gravity walls: same-colored objects compact sideways against their own wall while preserving each object's shape.

Reconstruct the repeated tile from its separated copies and mark the missing pixels in the damaged copy blue.

Input structure:
- The input is a lattice of equal-size blocks separated by one-cell solid rows
  and columns of the same separator color.
- All blocks are copies of one motif except exactly one block, where some
  motif pixels have been overwritten by the motif background color.
- Blue is absent from the input and is reserved as the output marker color.

Rule:
- Recover the motif by taking the unique majority color at each local block
  coordinate across all block copies.
- Find the single block that differs from this consensus motif.
- Return the consensus motif, recoloring the differing local coordinates blue.

Key insight:
- The repeated copies provide redundancy: the damaged positions are exactly
  the coordinates where the lone nonconforming copy has background instead of
  the consensus motif color.

Convert scattered foreground objects into bottom-aligned count bars in a fixed five-color order.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and foreground objects in the task
palette: grey, red, teal, maroon, and pink. Objects are monochromatic
8-connected components; some palette colors may be absent.

Rule
For each palette color in order grey, red, teal, maroon, pink, count its
8-connected objects. Create a background grid with five columns and height
equal to the largest count, then fill each column upward from the bottom
with its palette color for that count.

Key insight
The output does not preserve object shapes or positions; it is a histogram
of per-color 8-connected object counts, using the learned palette order.

Fill each plus-shaped background notch with the color of the frame side it opens toward.

Input structure
- A one-cell-thick rectangular frame has four solid-colored sides and neutral corner pixels.
- The frame interior contains a dominant background color and one foreground object color.
- Some object boundaries contain five-pixel plus-shaped background notches.

Rule
- Find every background plus whose opposite side is supported by foreground object pixels and whose open side faces one frame side.
- Recolor the five pixels of that plus with the color of the facing frame side.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
The frame side colors are direction labels for the open notches in the foreground object.

Drop the blue sprites downward relative to the red divider, with vertical sprites passing through to the bottom.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One non-background color forms a single full-width horizontal divider row.
- The other non-background color forms 4-connected sprites above the divider.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite pixels.
- A one-column sprite falls to the bottom of its column and deletes the divider
  pixel it crossed.
- Any wider sprite falls until its unique widest horizontal row is immediately
  above the divider row; if the moved sprite overlaps the divider, it covers it.

Key insight:
The red row is not a generic floor: only one-column sprites pass through to the
bottom, while wider sprites are registered by their widest horizontal segment.

Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

Count the two upper quadrant control regions to size an output made from the lower quadrant pattern.

Input structure:
- The grid is an even square split into four equal quadrants.
- Black is the background.
- The upper-left and upper-right quadrants are control regions.
- The lower-left quadrant is a color source tile; the lower-right quadrant is either a stencil tile or empty.

Rule:
- Output height is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-left quadrant.
- Output width is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-right quadrant.
- If the lower-right stencil has foreground pixels, tile it over the output; each stencil background pixel is filled from the lower-left quadrant cell at the corresponding coarse tile position.
- If the lower-right stencil is empty, tile the lower-left quadrant directly over the output.

Key insight:
- The top quadrants specify only dimensions, while the bottom quadrants specify a two-level repeated pattern: a fine stencil and coarse fill colors.

Sort objects to top or bottom edge by whether their shape (up to rotation/flip) is shared.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several multicolor connected components (8-connected) scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Compute each object's canonical shape (binary mask, invariant to rotation and flip).
- Objects whose shape appears in two or more components → translate to TOP edge (row 0).
- Objects whose shape is unique → translate to BOTTOM edge (row H−h).
- Horizontal position (left column) is preserved; only vertical translation changes.

Key insight: The sorting criterion is shape frequency (rotation-invariant), not area — duplicated shapes go up, unique shapes go down.

Extend each of two aligned rectangular marker objects toward the other, filling half of the gap across the full perpendicular span.

Input structure
- A dominant background contains exactly two solid, same-sized monochromatic rectangles.
- The rectangles share either the same row span or the same column span, with a background gap between their facing edges.

Rule
- If the rectangles are side-by-side, color the left half of the inter-object gap across every row with the left object's color, and the right half with the right object's color.
- If one rectangle is above the other, color the upper half of the gap across every column with the upper object's color, and the lower half with the lower object's color.
- When the gap length is odd, leave the center row/column as background.

Key insight
- The marker objects are endpoints of an axial corridor; their own size identifies the facing edge, while the filled corridor spans the whole grid perpendicular to that axis.

Draw a polyline by decoding 3x3 glyph instructions read across a divided grid.

Input structure:
- Left of a full-height vertical divider: 3x3 colored glyphs on bg.
- Right of divider: a single gray (5) start pixel.

Rule:
- Remove the divider; shift the gray start into the left canvas.
- Read glyphs in column-major order (left→right, top→bottom).
- Each glyph's shape (pixel area) encodes a segment: area 4 → down 2, area 5 → right 3, area 6 → left 4, area 7 → left 2.
- Append segments sequentially, stepping down one cell between each.

Key insight: Glyph pixel count (area) uniquely determines both segment length and direction — the shape itself is the instruction.

Draw the marker-colored route through the centers of all doors in the parallel wall maze.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background, parallel full-span walls, one three-pixel door
  segment in each wall, and two marker pixels sharing a color.
- Walls are either all vertical or all horizontal, and the markers are on
  opposite outer sides of the wall set.

Rule:
- Keep the scene unchanged except for the route.
- Visit the door centers in wall order from the upper/left marker side to
  the lower/right marker side.
- In each corridor, draw an orthogonal path to the cell just before the next
  wall, move along that wall to the door center, cross the center, and
  continue to the next corridor; after the last door, connect to the other
  marker.

Key insight:
- The three-pixel door segments mark the only crossing points through a set
  of parallel walls, so the output is the corridor path threaded through
  those centers.

Mark each arrow-like sprite's pointed frame endpoint with its color and the opposite endpoint black.

Input structure:
- The grid has a one-pixel solid rectangular frame around a dominant interior background.
- Inside the frame are monochrome six-pixel sprites shaped as asymmetric T arrows.
- Each sprite has a length-4 bar and a length-3 crossbar one cell closer to the pointed end.

Rule:
- For each sprite, follow its bar axis from the shorter end to the frame.
- Paint that frame endpoint with the sprite color.
- Paint the opposite endpoint on the same row or column black.
- Leave the interior background, sprites, and all other frame pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The direction is encoded by the crossbar's off-center position: the nearer end is the pointing end.

Erase each target-color object crossed by the ray pointed by the bar-and-control marker.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is one three-pixel straight marker bar and one singleton control pixel adjacent to the bar center.
- The remaining non-background color forms multiple 4-connected target objects.

Rule:
- Cast a straight ray from the marker bar center in the direction away from the adjacent control pixel.
- Find every 4-connected target-color object that intersects that ray.
- Recolor all pixels of those hit target objects to the background; all other pixels stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- The whole object is erased when the center ray touches any of its pixels; the full marker bar width is not swept.

Remove diagonal staircase noise and complete broken straight lines.

Input structure:
- bg = background; one foreground color fg forming axis-aligned lines.
- Some fg pixels form 45° diagonal chains (8-connected but 4-disconnected from lines).

Rule:
- Delete all diagonal-only fg pixels (those with no orthogonal fg neighbor, only diagonal ones).
- Fill short gaps in horizontal/vertical lines where a deleted diagonal was nearby.
- Prune remaining diagonal-adjacent leaf pixels near former diagonal sites.

Key insight: Diagonal pixels are hints marking where a straight line is broken; their span sets the maximum gap size to fill.

Recolor each non-singleton red object by its symmetry axis and erase isolated red pixels.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and red 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every non-singleton red object has exactly one reflection symmetry category:
  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- Single red pixels are noise.

Rule:
- Start from an all-background output of the same shape.
- Recolor horizontally symmetric red objects blue, vertically symmetric objects
  green, and diagonally symmetric objects pink.
- Leave isolated red pixels as background.

Key insight: The target color is not tied to object position or size; it is a
label for the object's reflection symmetry.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
