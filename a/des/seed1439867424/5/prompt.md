<description>
Mirror the smallest non-axis foreground color across the full straight axis.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color forms exactly one full row, column, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal reflection axis.
- The remaining foreground colors include a unique least-populated color to copy.

Rule
- Preserve the input grid.
- Select every pixel of the unique smallest non-axis foreground color.
- Reflect those pixels across the full straight axis and paint the reflected positions with the same color.

Key insight
- The axis color marks the mirror line, while the color population chooses which set of objects is duplicated.

Eject content pixels from cup-shaped frames outward along each cup's tail direction.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Hollow cup/Y/funnel frames, each a unique border color.
- Each cup has a convergent tail spike on one side and an open mouth on the opposite side.
- Content pixels (a single non-border color per cup) sit inside the cup's mouth interior.

Rule:
- For each cup, identify its tail spike and tail direction.
- Erase all content pixels from the mouth interior.
- Draw a straight line of content-colored pixels from the spike outward in the tail direction,
  one pixel per erased content pixel; cells beyond the grid edge are dropped.

Key insight: The tail spike is the unique convergent point whose outward direction is opposite
the mouth opening where the content lives.

Crop a board cluster and rotate its color layers based on outside cue sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- A main multi-color board cluster (largest foreground region).
- Small monochrome cue sprites outside the board for the colors that rotate.

Rule:
- Tight-crop around the board cluster.
- For each color layer inside the crop, find its same-color cue outside.
- Rotate that layer clockwise by (cue pixel count mod 4) × 90°.
- No outside cue → no rotation.

Key insight: Cue sprite size mod 4 encodes rotation amount for its matching color layer.

<description>
Swing an irregular line segment around a nearby obstacle sprite, preserving its pixel count.

Input structure:
- bg, bar color (straight lines perpendicular to the grid edge, one end on the border), segment color (irregular stroke attached to bar's inner endpoint), obstacle color (sprite near the bar terminal).

Rule:
- Each bar is perpendicular to the edge it touches; its inner (terminal) endpoint has an attached irregular segment.
- The segment detaches and re-routes: it travels from the terminal toward the nearest obstacle, hugs the obstacle's boundary, then exits at a 45° diagonal.
- Total painted pixels equal the original segment length.

Key insight: The segment behaves like a rope swung around the obstacle — attach at the nearest point, trace the skin, exit diagonally, conserving length.

<description>
Extract the single plain rectangle and redraw it with the aligned rectangles' border-relative marker pattern.

Input structure:
- The boundary color is the background/separator.
- Foreground objects are dense rectangular regions; exactly one rectangle has only its base color.
- Other rectangles contain their base color plus marker pixels.

Rule:
- Crop the only plain rectangle; this crop is the output canvas.
- Use marked rectangles whose row span overlaps the plain rectangle's row span.
- Transfer their marker pixels by preserving each marker run's distance from the nearest rectangle edges.

Key insight:
- The marked rectangles are examples of an edge-relative pattern, so the missing plain rectangle receives the same pattern resized to its own dimensions.

<description>
Crop off the control row and column, then cyclically roll the payload by the two marker offsets.

Input structure
- The grid is square, with a control row on top and a control column on the left.
- The control row and column share one filler color and one single-pixel marker color.
- The lower-right square is the payload and contains none of the control colors.

Rule
- Remove the top control row and left control column.
- Roll the remaining payload down by the marker's zero-based position in the left control column.
- Roll the payload right by the marker's zero-based position in the top control row.

Key insight
- The two border markers are cyclic shift amounts for the payload, not colors to preserve.

<description>
Compute a grey result bar by adding teal bar heights and subtracting red bar heights.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several bottom-aligned one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Teal bars are positive operands; red bars are negative operands.
- The penultimate column is an empty result slot.

Rule
- Keep every input bar unchanged.
- Compute result height = total teal bar height - total red bar height.
- Paint that many bottom cells of the penultimate column grey.

Key insight
- The bars encode arithmetic by height, with color providing the sign.

<description>
Swap the upper two-pixel segment and the lower two-pixel segment around the fixed center pixel.

Input structure:
- The grid is a 5x1 vertical column of individual colored pixels.
- The middle pixel is a separator between two same-size two-pixel segments.

Rule:
- Keep the middle pixel in place.
- Reverse the order of the two pixels above the middle.
- Reverse the order of the two pixels below the middle.

Key insight:
- The transformation is local vertical order reversal on each side of the center, not a color-specific rule.

<description>
Fill enclosed regions along a line seeded by unique border pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Colored lines/drawings on the grid.
- Unique single-pixel colors on the grid border mark seed endpoints of each line.

Rule:
- Each border seed pixel connects (8-connected) to a line drawing.
- Find closed bg cavities whose boundary touches that line.
- Flood-fill each such cavity with the seed pixel's color.

Key insight: Only cavities reachable through the seed's own line get filled; the seed's unique color acts as a per-line fill label.

<description>
Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

<description>
Expand each sparse color object into a filled rectangular region using its legend-paired fill color.

Input structure
A background-color grid has a two-column legend in columns 0 and 1, starting at row 0: each row gives
a source color in the left column and that source color's fill color in the right column.  Outside the
legend, the foreground pixels are sparse dot objects whose colors are exactly the legend source colors.

Rule
Clear the legend.  For each source color, take the bbox of all of its non-legend dots, expand that bbox
by one pixel in every direction, and fill background cells inside the expanded rectangle with the paired
legend fill color while preserving every original non-legend dot.

Key insight
The legend order is also the layer order: earlier legend rows are in front, so fill rectangles are painted
from the last legend row back to the first and higher-priority fills overwrite lower-priority fills.

Move bordered 5×5 squares to their designated grid edges by border color.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Azure (8) and red (2) bordered 5×5 squares with colored interiors, scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Azure squares → left edge (col 0); red squares → right edge (col W−5).
- Each square keeps its original row.
- Process azure left-to-right, red right-to-left (nearest-to-edge first).
- If a square's rows overlap an already-placed edge square, place it one square-width inward instead.

Key insight: Near-edge-first ordering plus row-overlap determines which square sits at the edge vs. the second column.

Move the closest reachable maroon pixels into the 3×3 block around the unique red center.

Input structure:
- bg = orange floor, magenta walls, scattered maroon (9) pixels.
- A unique red (2) pixel marks the center of a 3×3 destination block.

Rule:
- Maroon pixels connected to the destination through floor/maroon cells (not blocked by walls) are candidates.
- Rank candidates by distance to the destination; the closest ones fill the block in row-major order.
- Moved maroons are erased (replaced with floor color).

Key insight: Wall barriers restrict connectivity — only maroon pixels reachable via flood-fill through the floor qualify, so proximity alone isn't enough.

Carve color-matched motifs into solid blocks and pack them into a compact grid.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several solid 5×5 monochrome blocks, each a distinct non-bg color.
- For each block color, a small same-colored motif sprite elsewhere on the grid.

Rule:
- Match each motif to its same-colored 5×5 block.
- Center the motif within the block and recolor those cells to bg (punching holes).
- Pack all carved blocks into an output grid preserving their original row/column order, separated by 1-cell gaps and a 1-cell outer border.

Key insight: The motif acts as a stencil — it's not stamped onto the block but carved out of it as background holes.

Fold each straight red rod at its black marker, leaving the gray-anchored side fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each foreground object is a straight horizontal or vertical 4-connected rod.
- Each rod contains many pixels of one line color, one endpoint marker, and one
  interior control marker.

Rule:
- For every rod, keep the segment from the endpoint marker through the control
  marker unchanged.
- Move the line-color tail on the far side of the control marker to a
  perpendicular ray starting next to that marker.
- Choose the perpendicular direction with more space to the grid edge.

Key insight:
- The endpoint marker identifies the fixed side of the rod, while the control
  marker is the hinge; the tail folds into the larger open half-plane.

<description>
Extend each colored domino marker into a full row or column bar, with horizontal bars covering vertical bars at crossings.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Every foreground object is a 4-connected same-color domino of exactly two pixels.
- A horizontal domino marks a row to paint; a vertical domino marks a column to paint.

Rule:
- Paint each marked column entirely with the color of its vertical domino marker.
- Paint each marked row entirely with the color of its horizontal domino marker.
- Rows are painted after columns, so row bars overwrite column bars at intersections.

Key insight:
- The two-pixel orientation is the instruction: horizontal markers emit row bars, vertical markers emit column bars, and the only layering cue is row-over-column.

<description>
Erase each target-color object crossed by the ray pointed by the bar-and-control marker.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is one three-pixel straight marker bar and one singleton control pixel adjacent to the bar center.
- The remaining non-background color forms multiple 4-connected target objects.

Rule:
- Cast a straight ray from the marker bar center in the direction away from the adjacent control pixel.
- Find every 4-connected target-color object that intersects that ray.
- Recolor all pixels of those hit target objects to the background; all other pixels stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- The whole object is erased when the center ray touches any of its pixels; the full marker bar width is not swept.

<description>
Recolor the grey diagonal-chain regions in an orange field to teal.

Input structure
The input contains only grey pixels and orange pixels.  Grey pixels form
several 8-connected regions embedded in the orange field.

Rule
Decompose each grey 8-connected region into 4-connected lobes.  Recolor the
whole region teal only when it contains a straight diagonal run of at least
three pixels and those lobes meet only by diagonal corner contacts in a
non-branching diagonal chain or cycle; a single 4-connected region is
recolored only when it is a square diagonal staircase.

Key insight
The teal regions are not selected by size or position; they are the grey
regions whose internal connectivity depends on diagonal corner joins, while
same-edge cracks, rectangles, bars, and branching/noisy regions remain grey.

<description>
Build the woven rectangle determined by the two marked cells on each crossed bar.

Input structure
A black-background grid contains one long horizontal bar and one long vertical bar.
Each bar has a dominant base color and exactly two same-colored marker pixels.

Rule
The horizontal marker pair gives the output column span.  From the horizontal bar
row, walk toward the farther vertical marker; rows and columns alternate every
other cell.  Even step/even offset cells use the horizontal marker color until
the nearer vertical marker is reached, then use the vertical marker color.
Odd row steps use the horizontal base on marker columns and the original
crossing color on spacer columns.  Spacer columns on even row steps use the
vertical base, except at the switch row where they use the crossing color.

Key insight
The original cross cell records which base color wins at base/base lattice
crossings; the nearer vertical marker is the color-switch boundary.

<description>
Swap a connector segment with repeated marker sprites by connecting the marker anchors and stamping the sprite at the segment endpoints.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors. One foreground color forms a single straight 8-connected segment. The other foreground color forms two or more identical centered sprites.

Rule
Build a background canvas of the same size. Draw straight connector-color segments between every pair of original sprite anchors. Then stamp the marker sprite, using its centered anchor, onto the two endpoints of the original connector segment.

Key insight
The original segment endpoints are the destinations for the repeated sprite, while the original sprite centers become the vertices of the new connector-color complete graph.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
