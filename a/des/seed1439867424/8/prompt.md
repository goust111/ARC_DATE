<description>
Repeat each 3x3 control-center sprite toward the matching solid rectangle until a copy first overlaps that rectangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each sprite is a 3x3 foreground object whose eight border pixels have one color and whose center has a different control color.
- For every control color, there is exactly one separate solid rectangular object of that color.

Rule
- Match each sprite to the unique solid rectangle whose color equals the sprite center.
- Copy the whole 3x3 sprite in the cardinal direction of that rectangle, stepping by three cells each time.
- Stop after pasting the first copy whose 3x3 bbox overlaps the rectangle; copied pixels overwrite the rectangle there.

Key insight
The center pixel is not the paint color: it is a destination key, while the entire 3x3 sprite is the motif tiled along the straight path.

Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Turn black dents in two colored regions into marked opposite-color patches.

Input structure:
- Black background with two large foreground colors.
- The large regions contain small black dents and a few one-cell color specks
  or protrusions along region boundaries.

Rule:
- Locally clean the two foreground regions: isolated specks become black, and
  one-cell protrusions surrounded by the other region take that region's color.
- Each original black dent whose cleaned 3x3 neighborhood is mostly one
  foreground color becomes the center of a 3x3 patch in the opposite color.
- The dent center itself is recolored teal (8).

Key insight: The teal pixels mark the original black defects; the surrounding
3x3 patch uses the other foreground color, after first removing boundary noise.

Recolor the two diagonal foreground-bar orientations, assigning teal to the larger orientation and red to the smaller one.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground color.
- Foreground pixels form one-cell-thick diagonal bars.
- Every foreground pixel belongs to exactly one diagonal orientation.

Rule
- Keep the background unchanged.
- Classify each foreground pixel by whether it has a diagonal neighbor on the NW/SE axis or the NE/SW axis.
- Recolor the orientation with more foreground pixels teal and the other orientation red.

Key insight
- The output colors depend on the relative population of the two diagonal orientations, not on a fixed slash direction or position.

Draw the marker-colored route through the centers of all doors in the parallel wall maze.

Input structure:
- The grid has a background, parallel full-span walls, one three-pixel door
  segment in each wall, and two marker pixels sharing a color.
- Walls are either all vertical or all horizontal, and the markers are on
  opposite outer sides of the wall set.

Rule:
- Keep the scene unchanged except for the route.
- Visit the door centers in wall order from the upper/left marker side to
  the lower/right marker side.
- In each corridor, draw an orthogonal path to the cell just before the next
  wall, move along that wall to the door center, cross the center, and
  continue to the next corridor; after the last door, connect to the other
  marker.

Key insight:
- The three-pixel door segments mark the only crossing points through a set
  of parallel walls, so the output is the corridor path threaded through
  those centers.

Move the lower sprite and its pink guide into the upper panel, aligning the sprite to the guide's lower-left branch.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one full-width separator row.
- Below the separator are exactly two foreground roles: a five-pixel guide marker and one monochrome sprite.
- The guide marker has normalized shape {(0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1)} and starts immediately below the separator.

Rule
- Clear the canvas to the background, preserving the separator row.
- Translate the guide marker upward so its top row becomes row 0.
- Move the sprite, preserving its color and shape, so the sprite bbox bottom-right aligns to the translated guide's lower-left branch.

Key insight
- The marker supplies the destination anchor: its lower-left branch cell is where the moved sprite's bbox bottom-right must land.

Transfer sprites from red-marked lanes to green-marked lanes, recoloring and stacking.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Red (2) and green (3) thin bars define vertical lanes.
- Each lane contains repeated identical monochrome sprites in an evenly spaced vertical grid.

Rule:
- Each red lane's sprites turn grey (5); their count transfers to the nearest green lane.
- New sprites fill empty lattice slots bottom-up, using the source shape recolored to the destination lane's sprite color.
- All marker bars are removed.

Key insight: Sprite count is conserved across lanes — red sprites become grey, and equally many new sprites stack into the green lane's regular grid.

<description>
Delete each foreign-color object whose bounding box is contained by a larger object of another color.

Input structure
- The black pixels are the empty canvas, and every other color forms one or more 8-connected monochromatic objects.
- Some larger foreground objects act as loose U/C-like containers around smaller objects of different colors.
Rule
- Find all 8-connected monochromatic non-black objects.
- Recolor an object to black exactly when its bounding box is contained in the bounding box of a larger object of another color.
- Keep all other pixels unchanged.
Key insight
- The removable objects are identified by containment in another color's rectangular extent, not by their own color or shape.

Project the framed periodic stripe pattern across the canvas and erase the unused frame cells.

Input structure
- A bg canvas with a one-cell-thick rectangular frame of one color.
- Inside the frame are two parallel full-interior marker bars of another color.
- A third color fills the region between the marker bars on periodically spaced rows or columns.

Rule
- Infer the periodic row or column mask from the third-color stripes inside the frame.
- Paint the frame color along those full rows or columns, extended to the grid boundary.
- Extend the marker bars across the full canvas and repaint the source-color stripe cells between them.

Key insight
- The outer frame is not preserved as a border; it supplies the color for the periodic stripes selected by the inner source pattern.

Keep the larger sprite from each separated panel and overlay those sprites into one 5x5 canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a 5x17 grid: three 5x5 panels separated by one-cell black columns.
- Each panel has the same background color and exactly one foreground color split into two 4-connected components.

Rule:
- In each panel, discard the smaller foreground component and keep the unique largest component as the sprite.
- Process panels left to right, placing each sprite at its panel coordinates on a 5x5 background canvas.
- If a sprite would cover an already placed sprite, slide it by the unique nearest in-bounds offset that avoids overlap.

Key insight:
- The extra same-colored component in each panel is a distractor; the final answer is the non-overlapping overlay of the three largest components.

Move magenta particles along corridors formed by parallel colored bars.

Input structure:
- bg=7. Particles=6 in col 0. Colored bars on even rows form corridors on odd rows.

Rule:
- Particle goes straight through bg cells.
- When blocked by a colored cell, turns 90° into the perpendicular direction
  that has a bg cell flanked by same-color bars. Stops at grid edge or full blockage.

Key insight: Same-color parallel bars define the only valid corridors, so each particle follows a deterministic local trace.

Extend the diagonal blue ray through the grid, reflecting it off red line-segment mirrors.

Input structure
- Black-background grid with one diagonal 8-connected blue ray seed.
- Red foreground objects, when present, are straight horizontal or vertical mirror segments.
- Other foreground bars are transparent to the ray and may be overwritten where the ray crosses them.

Rule
- Start from the ray seed endpoint whose outward diagonal extension remains inside the grid.
- Paint the ray continuously in that diagonal direction until it leaves the grid.
- If the next cell is a red mirror, do not paint it; reflect by flipping the row direction on a horizontal mirror or the column direction on a vertical mirror.

Key insight
- The non-red bars are decoys: only red bars reflect the diagonal path, while all other crossed cells become blue.

Fill rectangular cavities in a template shape by placing source sprites into matching holes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. A dominant "base" color forms a large frame/template with rectangular gaps.
- Small colored sprites sit outside the template region.

Rule:
- The base color (largest connected component excluding bg) defines the template bbox.
- Each rectangular hole inside the template matches exactly one outside sprite by size.
- Place each sprite into its matching cavity; output is the filled template bbox.

Key insight: Sprite bounding boxes match cavity dimensions exactly — it's a jigsaw-fit puzzle where each piece has a unique slot.

Replace each colored corner marker with its corner-specific inward stencil in the same color.

Input structure
- The grid is 8x8 with a single dominant background color.
- Foreground pixels are marker pixels, each located at one of the four corners.
- A marker's color is carried to the stencil selected by its corner position.

Rule
- Erase each corner marker back to the background.
- Top corner markers become an inward 2x2 block one cell away from the top and side edges.
- Bottom corner markers become the mirrored three-pixel inward bent stencil shown by the bottom-corner examples.

Key insight
- The marker position selects the fixed stencil; the marker color only supplies the paint color, so multiple corners apply independently.

Attach monochrome sprites to the matching sides of a central hollow square.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A hollow NxN square (hub) with bg corners/interior and four differently-colored edges (top, bottom, left, right).
- 2-4 monochrome sprites scattered on the grid, each matching one hub edge color.

Rule:
- For each hub edge color, find the matching sprite outside the hub.
- Rotate the sprite (0/90/180/270°) so its contact edge has exactly N-2 contiguous cells aligned with the hub side, and the rotated sprite is mirror-symmetric along the contact-edge axis (UD for left/right, LR for top/bottom).
- Translate it to adjoin that hub side. 
- Clear everything else to bg; output is hub + attached sprites only.

Key insight: Each edge color uniquely pairs a sprite to a side; symmetry along the contact-edge axis disambiguates the correct rotation.

Mark the center of each odd-sized solid square with the plus marker color, erasing the marker only when it is outside the marked-center field.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: one unique 3x3 plus marker and one color forming separated solid square objects.

Rule:
- For every non-marker 4-connected object, assert it is a solid square.
- If the square side length is odd, recolor its center pixel to the plus marker color; even-sided squares stay unchanged.
- Preserve the plus marker when its center lies inside the bounding box of the odd-square centers; otherwise erase it to background.

Key insight:
- Odd-sided solid squares have a single visible center pixel, and the plus supplies the color used to identify those centers.

Connect same-colored foreground components with one-cell-wide orthogonal paths around teal wall segments.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Teal cells are fixed wall segments and are never source connectors.
- Other foreground colors appear as one or more 4-connected components; colors with a single component stay unchanged.

Rule
- For each non-background, non-teal color, read its 4-connected components in row-major order.
- Connect each consecutive pair by the shortest clear L-shaped path between the two components.
- Clear paths may pass only through background or the same color, and they preserve the previous travel axis when both bends are possible.

Key insight
- The output is not a global recolor: each color traces a routed chain through its own components while teal cells and other colors act as blockers.

Within each horizontal pair of two-color panels, swap the motif masks and recolor each pasted mask with the source panel's base color.

Input structure:
- A separator color forms full blank rows and at least one full blank column.
- The non-separator area is split into row bands, each containing exactly two same-shaped rectangular panels.
- Each panel has a dominant base color and one minority motif color.

Rule:
- For every row band, clear each panel to its own base color.
- Paste the right panel's motif mask into the left panel using the right base color.
- Paste the left panel's motif mask into the right panel using the left base color.

Key insight:
- The motif colors themselves are distractors; only each motif's shape mask and the two panel base colors are exchanged.

Move each mirrored bottom source pixel to the far end of its trail and redraw the top half as its reflection.

Input structure
- A solid non-background row separates equal-height top and bottom halves.
- The top half has one marker color on the background.
- In the bottom half, exactly one color has positions that mirror the top markers across the separator, and the other color forms trails touching those source pixels.

Rule
- Identify the bottom source color by reflecting each bottom color into the top half and matching the top marker set.
- For every bottom source pixel, follow its unique 4-connected trail of the other bottom color to the trail endpoint.
- Clear the old top markers, bottom sources, and trails; place the source color at each endpoint and place the top marker color at the reflected endpoint.

Key insight
- The top half is only a mirror display of the bottom moving sources; the actual motion is encoded by the trail attached to each bottom source pixel.

Recolor grey shapes by matching their hole count to a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; grey (5) sprites scattered across the grid.
- Colored legend shapes (non-bg, non-grey, at least 2×2, not touching the outer border) near grid edge,
  each with a distinct number of enclosed holes.

Rule:
- Each colored legend shape defines a mapping: hole count → color.
- For every grey sprite, count its holes (enclosed bg regions not touching the sprite's bounding-box border).
- Recolor the grey sprite to the matching legend color; erase grey distractors with unlisted hole counts.

Key insight: Shape identity is encoded by topology (number of holes), not geometry or size.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
