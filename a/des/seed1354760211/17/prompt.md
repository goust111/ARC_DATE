<description>
Repeat the bottom foreground motif upward until it fills the whole grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground pixels occupy a contiguous block of rows at the bottom.
- That bottom block is the complete vertical motif, including its background cells.

Rule
- Copy the bottom motif rows repeatedly upward across the full grid.
- Preserve horizontal alignment and vertical phase: the original first motif row remains at its input row.
- The output shape is unchanged.

Key insight
The blank rows above the bottom foreground block are missing repetitions of the same row motif, not empty space.

Stamp source sprites into a destination frame via color-matched singleton markers.

Input structure:
- Two bordered rectangles: source (multi-cell sprites) and destination (singleton markers).
- Each sprite has an anchor pixel — its least-frequent color. Markers share these colors.

Rule:
- Match each destination marker to the source sprite with the same anchor color.
- Translate the sprite so its anchor overlaps the marker position.
- Output is the destination rectangle, interior cleared before stamping.

Key insight: The rarest color per sprite doubles as a template key and positioning anchor.

Merge same-sized filled rectangular objects by overlaying their internal marker pixels.

Input structure:
- A dominant background surrounds two or more separated 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every object is a filled rectangle of the same size.
- Each rectangle has the same majority base color plus one or more non-base marker pixels.

Rule:
- Create one output rectangle with the shared object size, filled with the shared base color.
- For each input rectangle, copy every non-base marker pixel to the same relative location
  in the output.
- Marker overlays must either land on base color or agree in color with an existing marker.

Key insight:
The separated rectangles are layers of the same template; their colored marker pixels
combine by local coordinates while the repeated base fill is just the output canvas.

Fill the region enclosed by a wall sprite and radiate color outward through its opening.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall = most frequent non-bg color, forming a partial enclosure (e.g. U-shape).
- A fill-color pixel sits inside the enclosed area. Other non-bg pixels may act as obstacles.
Rule:
- Flood-fill the enclosed area with the fill color, radiating outward through the wall's open end.
- Obstacles cast "shadows" along the radiate direction, blocking fill behind them.

Key insight: The wall endpoints define the opening direction; fill radiates outward through it, and obstacles block propagation along that same axis.

<description>
Stamp recolored sprites into a framed region using placeholder positions and a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg background, a rectangular single-color frame, colored placeholder cells inside the frame.
- Outside the frame: sprite shapes (one per placeholder color) and a small legend mapping each placeholder color to an output color.

Rule:
- Find the frame and its interior placeholders.
- For each placeholder color, locate the matching-color sprite outside the frame.
- Stamp each sprite at the placeholder's position inside the frame.
- Recolor every stamped sprite to the output color defined by the legend.

Key insight: The legend pairs (overlapping two-color glyphs outside the frame) dictate the final recoloring — placeholder color selects the shape, legend maps it to the output color.

<description>
Fill the parallelogram-shaped region between parallel anti-diagonal line segments with red.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One non-bg color forms short diagonal segments, each lying on a single anti-diagonal (r+c = const).
- Segments come in parallel pairs bounding a region to be filled.

Rule:
- For each main-diagonal axis (r−c = const), collect anti-diagonal segments whose span covers that axis.
- Sort those segments by their anti-diagonal index (r+c).
- Fill all bg cells lying strictly between consecutive segment pairs along that axis with red (color 2).

Key insight: The two diagonal directions decouple — segments sit on anti-diagonals, and filling sweeps along main diagonals between them, forming parallelogram regions.

Project maroon markers into adjacent grey or pink 3x3 squares, erasing grey squares afterward.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, solid 3x3 grey and/or pink squares, and maroon marker pixels or segments directly touching one side of exactly one square.
Rule
Grey squares are erased; their adjacent maroon markers stay in place and stamp the nearest edge cell inside the grey square. Pink squares stay pink; their adjacent maroon markers disappear and stamp the corresponding cell on the square's middle row or middle column.
Key insight
The side touched by a marker determines the projection: grey uses the near edge, while pink uses the centerline, preserving the marker's coordinate along that side.

<description>
Sort objects to top or bottom edge by whether their shape (up to rotation/flip) is shared.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several multicolor connected components (8-connected) scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Compute each object's canonical shape (binary mask, invariant to rotation and flip).
- Objects whose shape appears in two or more components → translate to TOP edge (row 0).
- Objects whose shape is unique → translate to BOTTOM edge (row H−h).
- Horizontal position (left column) is preserved; only vertical translation changes.

Key insight: The sorting criterion is shape frequency (rotation-invariant), not area — duplicated shapes go up, unique shapes go down.

<description>
Build the woven rectangle determined by the two marked cells on each crossed bar.

Input structure
A black-background grid contains one long horizontal bar and one long vertical bar.
Each bar has a dominant base color and exactly two same-colored marker pixels.

Rule
The horizontal marker pair gives the output column span.  From the horizontal bar
row, walk toward the farther vertical marker; rows and columns alternate every
other cell.  Even step/even offset cells use the horizontal marker color until
the nearer vertical marker is reached, then use the vertical marker color.
Odd row steps use the horizontal base on marker columns and the original
crossing color on spacer columns.  Spacer columns on even row steps use the
vertical base, except at the switch row where they use the crossing color.

Key insight
The original cross cell records which base color wins at base/base lattice
crossings; the nearer vertical marker is the color-switch boundary.

<description>
Rotate every foreground bar 90 degrees around its own center on the same canvas.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and all foreground pixels share one color.
Each 4-connected foreground object is a solid one-cell-thick horizontal or vertical
bar with odd length, with single-pixel bars allowed.

Rule
Clear the canvas to the background, then redraw every bar with its midpoint, length,
and color preserved while swapping horizontal and vertical orientation.

Key insight
The bars are independent objects: their centers and lengths identify the output
placement, so no matching, ordering, or global symmetry is needed.

Fill partitioned regions with concentric colored bands derived from marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Grid partitioned into regions by wall-colored lines.
- Each region has a dominant base color and a few isolated marker pixels of other colors at varying depths from the region boundary.

Rule:
- For each region, read marker colors ordered by their Chebyshev distance from the boundary to build a color palette.
- If no marker sits on the boundary itself, the base color leads the palette.
- Paint every cell with palette[distance mod palette_length], producing repeating concentric rectangular frames that radiate inward.

Key insight: Each marker's depth from the boundary defines its position in the cyclic palette; the pattern then tiles inward automatically.

Add a quantity-color label in the top marker column for each horizontal bar.

Input structure
- The grid has a black background and one non-background marker pixel in the top row.
- Below the marker row, every non-empty source row contains one solid monochrome horizontal bar to the left of the marker column.
- Source rows are staggered every other row.

Rule
- Copy the input grid.
- For each source bar, read its quantity as the bar length.
- Paint the quantity color in the marker column on the same row as the bar:
  2->1, 3->4, 4->9, 5->6.

Key insight
- The grey marker supplies the result column, while each bar supplies a small quantity with a fixed color code.

<description>
Mark the center of each odd-sized solid square with the plus marker color, erasing the marker only when it is outside the marked-center field.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is background.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: one unique 3x3 plus marker and one color forming separated solid square objects.

Rule:
- For every non-marker 4-connected object, assert it is a solid square.
- If the square side length is odd, recolor its center pixel to the plus marker color; even-sided squares stay unchanged.
- Preserve the plus marker when its center lies inside the bounding box of the odd-square centers; otherwise erase it to background.

Key insight:
- Odd-sided solid squares have a single visible center pixel, and the plus supplies the color used to identify those centers.

<description>
Extend row bars periodically across the opposite side of a separator column.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A near-solid vertical separator divides the grid into two sides.
- One side contains horizontal colored bars; the other side is blank target space.
- Bars may be stacked by row and may sit at different distances from the separator.

Rule:
- Identify the separator as the column whose non-bg cells are one color.
- Treat the denser side as the bar side and collect each contiguous row run.
- Process bars from nearest to farthest from the separator; for each bar, paint its
  color every bar-length cells into the blank side without overwriting earlier paint.

Key insight: Each bar's length is the period for its extension, and nearer bars claim target cells first.

Complete sparse nested rectangular color layers into solid rectangles.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and every foreground color marks one
axis-aligned rectangular layer; the layer bboxes have unique areas and are
nested from outermost to innermost.
Rule
Take each color's bbox as its completed rectangle, except that a child bbox
which already matches at least three sides of its parent's one-pixel inset
expands to that full inset; repaint the rectangles largest to smallest.
Key insight
The scattered pixels are samples of nested rectangular regions, so the
output is a clean redraw of those regions with inner colors overwriting
outer colors.

Split the two-color object horizontally, swap its colors, and slide the upper half to the right.

Input structure:
- The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- All foreground pixels form one 4-connected object with an even-height bbox.
- The object has foreground pixels on both rows adjacent to its horizontal midpoint.

Rule:
- Split the object into upper and lower halves at the midpoint of its bbox.
- Swap the two foreground colors in both halves.
- Keep the lower half in place and shift the upper half right until its lower-left
  boundary pixel is diagonally adjacent to the lower half's upper-right boundary pixel.

Key insight:
- The object is not copied or reflected; it is broken at the horizontal waist,
  recolored by exchanging the two visible object colors, then rejoined diagonally.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by replacing singleton markers, filling short orthogonal gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
- Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
- Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all singleton pixels.
- Red singleton markers are missing line cells; yellow singleton markers are directional controls next to a line endpoint.

Rule:
- Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, preferring an endpoint supported along that same axis.
- For each line color, fill the gap between consecutive facing endpoints in a row or column.
- A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
- At crossings, yellow-control rays win; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while pure filled crossings use the lower color id.

Key insight: The singleton markers identify which sparse stroke fragments belong together; after they are colored, the intended lines are the axis-aligned gaps between facing endpoints, with yellow controls flipping one arm to the marked side.

<description>
Replicate a pre-drawn corner pattern to every other marker-bearing corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most frequent color. Hollow 0-frames (possibly partial L-shapes); each
  frame-corner cell is either 0 or a painted (non-bg, non-0) color.
- >= 1 'source' corner: the pattern is already drawn (one color, both outward
  cells and an inward-diagonal trail).
- Other corners: a single colored pixel on the inward diagonal at the pattern's
  deepest (k,k) offset; the pixel's color is that corner's target color.

Rule:
- Extract the canonical (TL-oriented) pattern from any source.
- For each non-source corner whose marker cell is colored, paint the same
  pattern rotated to that corner's orientation, using the marker's color.

Key insight: the pattern is symmetric about the corner's inward-diagonal axis
(canonical dr == dc), so it reflects cleanly across all four corner orientations.
Painting uses each target's OWN marker color, not the source color.

Paint each pink control pixel as a teal horizontal bar whose reach equals the foreground counts on that row.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one or more pink control pixels.
- Each marker row has exactly one pink pixel; all other non-background pixels
  in that row are counters.
Rule
- Start from an all-background output grid.
- For each pink pixel, count non-background pixels strictly to its left and
  strictly to its right in the same row.
- Paint teal from c - left_count through c + right_count on that row.
Key insight
- The foreground pixels are not copied; only their counts on each side of
  each pink marker encode the teal bar length.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
