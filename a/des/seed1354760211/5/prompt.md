Count the two upper quadrant control regions to size an output made from the lower quadrant pattern.

Input structure:
- The grid is an even square split into four equal quadrants.
- Black is the background.
- The upper-left and upper-right quadrants are control regions.
- The lower-left quadrant is a color source tile; the lower-right quadrant is either a stencil tile or empty.

Rule:
- Output height is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-left quadrant.
- Output width is the number of non-background pixels in the upper-right quadrant.
- If the lower-right stencil has foreground pixels, tile it over the output; each stencil background pixel is filled from the lower-left quadrant cell at the corresponding coarse tile position.
- If the lower-right stencil is empty, tile the lower-left quadrant directly over the output.

Key insight:
- The top quadrants specify only dimensions, while the bottom quadrants specify a two-level repeated pattern: a fine stencil and coarse fill colors.

Extract the central object from the marker cluster whose markers have the same color.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background and several clusters; each cluster has four
same-color corner marker objects around one central monochromatic object.
Rule
Find every central object enclosed by four aligned corner markers of one color,
then choose the unique one whose object color equals the marker color.
Key insight
The answer is not the largest or most frequent object; it is the center of the
self-colored cluster, cropped to that object's bounding box with background kept.

Transmit colored tokens along wire networks, converting each to its complementary 3×3 pattern.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Non-bg cells form wire networks and 3×3 tokens (solid blocks or X/diagonal patterns) near wire endpoints.

Rule:
- Every solid 3×3 token is replaced in-place by a diamond (center + 4 cardinal neighbors).
- Each token near a wire endpoint sends its complement to the opposite endpoint: solid emits X, X emits diamond.

Key insight: Token shape cycles solid → X → diamond; wires route each complement to the far end.

<description>
Untangle overlapping colored rectangular frames into concentric square frames ordered by their visible crossings.

Input structure
- The background contains several one-cell-thick axis-aligned rectangular frames, one color per frame.
- Frames overlap, and the visible color at an overlap records a directed crossing from the hidden frame to the visible frame.
- Each foreground color still has visible pixels on the perimeter of its full rectangular bounding box.

Rule
- Infer each color's full rectangular frame from the bounding box of its visible pixels.
- Add a directed edge A -> B when B is visible at a crossing of A and B's frame perimeters.
- Find the unique path that visits every frame color once, then render those colors as one-pixel-thick concentric square frames from outside to inside.

Key insight
- The output is not a crop of the input; the crossing graph gives a single frame order, and that order is redrawn as nested rings.

<description>
Pack the non-background rows from three separated panels into one panel, scanning panels right-to-left.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid contains three equal-size panels separated by two full-height divider columns.
- The background is the dominant color; divider pixels use a color that appears only in the divider columns.

Rule:
- Read panels from right to left, and within each panel read rows from top to bottom.
- Keep each row that contains any non-background pixel, discarding all-background rows.
- Place the kept rows at the bottom of a single panel-shaped output, padding above with background rows.

Key insight:
- The task is row packing: the divider columns mark independent panels, and only the occupied rows are moved.

Clean each color layer by enforcing vertical mirror symmetry.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Several non-bg colors, each forming a nearly-symmetric pattern about some vertical axis.
- Some pixels in each color are "noise" that breaks the symmetry.

Rule:
- For each non-bg color, find the vertical axis that best explains its pixel layout.
- Remove any pixel that lacks a same-color mirror counterpart across that axis.

Key insight: Each color has its own independent symmetry axis; the task is per-color denoising, not whole-grid symmetry.

Complete each partially hidden simple foreground shape by recoloring the occluding pixels in its footprint.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several solid foreground shapes.
- Some shapes are partially hidden by other foreground colors, but their full
  footprint is still indicated by a foreground-filled bbox or by a foreground-
  filled 45-degree diagonal line.

Rule
- For each foreground color, complete its full rectangular bbox when that bbox
  contains no background and includes other colors.
- Otherwise, complete its 45-degree diagonal line when all visible pixels lie
  on that line and the hidden line cells are foreground, not background.
- Recolor only those hidden footprint pixels; leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The occluded cells are exactly the non-background cells inside a simple
  shape's implied footprint, so completing shapes is a local recoloring problem.

Fill the background under a top-row red/grey span with a shrinking diagonal pattern that alternates red and grey.

Input structure:
- The grid has an orange background.
- All foreground pixels are red or grey and lie on the top row.
- The first and last top-row foreground pixels define an odd-width span.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- For row r below the top, fill columns span_left + r through span_right - r.
- Each filled cell takes the top-row color r columns up-left, flipped red<->grey once per row step.

Key insight:
- The output is the top-row span propagated down-right along diagonals, while the allowable region shrinks inward from both ends each row.

Fill enclosed regions along a line seeded by unique border pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Colored lines/drawings on the grid.
- Unique single-pixel colors on the grid border mark seed endpoints of each line.

Rule:
- Each border seed pixel connects (8-connected) to a line drawing.
- Find closed bg cavities whose boundary touches that line.
- Flood-fill each such cavity with the seed pixel's color.

Key insight: Only cavities reachable through the seed's own line get filled; the seed's unique color acts as a per-line fill label.

Recolor every target pixel by following the ordered two-column substitution legend.

Input structure
- A dominant background surrounds one multicolor vertical legend: a connected,
  fully filled two-column block with one color pair per row.
- Other non-background pixels or objects are the targets; divider or frame
  pixels are ordinary target-side structure that remain unchanged unless their
  color is rewritten by the legend.

Rule
- Read the legend rows from top to bottom as substitutions from the left
  column color to the right column color.
- For each non-background pixel outside the legend, scan those rows in order;
  whenever the current color equals the row's left color, replace it with the
  row's right color and keep scanning lower rows.
- Leave the legend itself and background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The same color may be rewritten multiple times, but only by substitutions
  that appear later in the vertical legend, so the row order is part of the
  symbol instruction.

Dock movable tools into border-anchored frames by filling cavities.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Border-touching components cluster into anchor frames with interior bg cavities.
- Non-border 2-color components are movable tools.

Rule:
- Match each tool to a frame whose cavity size equals one of its color-region counts.
- Rotate/flip the tool so one color fills the cavity exactly; the other stays outside.
- If the docking orientation uses a reflection, swap the tool's two colors.

Key insight: Cavity size determines tool–frame pairing; reflection triggers color swap.

Connect same-colored foreground components with one-cell-wide orthogonal paths around teal wall segments.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Teal cells are fixed wall segments and are never source connectors.
- Other foreground colors appear as one or more 4-connected components; colors with a single component stay unchanged.

Rule
- For each non-background, non-teal color, read its 4-connected components in row-major order.
- Connect each consecutive pair by the shortest clear L-shaped path between the two components.
- Clear paths may pass only through background or the same color, and they preserve the previous travel axis when both bends are possible.

Key insight
- The output is not a global recolor: each color traces a routed chain through its own components while teal cells and other colors act as blockers.

Complete a four-corner framed rectangle from one decorated anchor rectangle and its diagonal mate.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Two same-color solid rectangular anchors of the same size sit on opposite
  diagonal corners, with the first anchor above-left of the second.
- The upper-left anchor has two one-cell-thick vertical control bars to its
  right and two one-cell-thick horizontal control bars below it.

Rule:
- Copy the anchor rectangle into the two missing corners of the implied
  larger rectangle.
- Repeat the right-side control bars horizontally between the left and right
  anchors, using their spacing as the period, and draw the outer top and
  bottom borders in the first right-control color.
- Repeat the below-side control bars vertically between the top and bottom
  anchors, using the same period, and draw the outer left and right borders
  in the first below-control color.

Key insight: The small control bars are the first two ticks of two periodic
frame patterns; the diagonal anchor supplies the opposite corner and the
missing two anchor copies.

Grow four clockwise spiral wall paths from the tips of a teal cross.

Input structure:
- bg = 0 (black). A single teal (8) cross centered in the grid.

Rule:
- Each arm tip launches a "turtle" heading 90° right of its outward direction.
- Movement priority: turn right > go straight > turn left (left only if not on border).
- Normal step = 2 cells; step right after a turn = 1 cell.
- Each new cell must have a 1-cell orthogonal gap from all existing walls except the predecessor.

Key insight: The right-turn preference plus alternating 2/1 step lengths creates self-avoiding spirals that tile the grid with uniform spacing.

Mirror colored sprites using red (2) markers as reflection axes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Red (2) = marker color.
- Colored sprites appear near red markers.

Rule:
- Red line within a sprite (vertical or horizontal) → mirror payload across that axis.
- Single red pixel in a mixed sprite → point-reflect payload around it.
- Isolated red pixel (alone, no payload) → point-reflect each adjacent 8-connected color component.
- Originals remain; mirrored pixels overlay.

Key insight: Red marker geometry (line vs single pixel) determines reflection type; isolated vs embedded red determines what gets reflected.

Rotate the colors around every 3x3 foreground ring, with corners and side-centers cycling in opposite directions.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- Each 4-connected foreground object is a complete 3x3 ring: eight foreground pixels around a background center.

Rule
- For each ring, move corner colors one step around the four corners.
- Move side-center colors one step around the four side centers in the opposite direction.
- Leave the background center and all other background pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Corners and side centers form two separate four-cycles on the same 3x3 ring.

Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

Crop the largest object and overlay each smaller sprite where its shared marker pattern matches.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color, and the foreground has one largest destination object plus smaller source sprites.
- Each source sprite shares exactly one marker color with the destination object.

Rule
- Output the tight bbox crop of the largest object.
- Translate each source sprite so every connected marker component of the shared color exactly matches destination marker components.
- Paste source sprites in decreasing area order, so smaller sprites can sit on top of larger ones when they overlap.

Key insight
- The shared-color marker components are alignment keys; matching whole marker components distinguishes singleton slots from larger same-color marker blocks.

Recolor each side-marked multicolor object embedded in a monochrome panel to its marker color.

Input structure:
- Same-color 4-connected components form monochrome panel regions.
- The bounding box of a panel may contain 4-connected non-panel-color objects.
- A target object touches exactly one side of its panel bbox, and all of its
  pixels on that side have one marker color.

Rule:
- For every target object, fill any panel-colored holes enclosed by the object.
- Recolor the object and filled holes to the side marker color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- A multicolor object's single contact side identifies both which object should
  be normalized and which color should replace it.

Complete the sparse colored marker pattern by reflecting it across a full-row/full-column cross.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background and one non-background cross color that
fills exactly one complete row and one complete column. All other foreground
pixels are sparse markers away from that cross.

Rule
Keep the input unchanged, and for each marker pixel copy its color to the
positions obtained by reflecting it across the cross row, across the cross
column, and across both axes. Reflected positions outside the grid are
clipped.

Key insight
The full cross is not a copied object; it is the pair of mirror axes for
completing the quadrant pattern.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
