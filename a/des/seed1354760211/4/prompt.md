<description>
Insert red components into interior sockets of large structures, leaving a black trail.

Input structure:
- bg = most common. Large non-bg, non-red structures with interior cavities.
- Red components outside structures.

Rule:
- Interior sockets: bg cells inside a structure's bbox, adjacent to structure pixels.
- For each structure, find the direction where rays from sockets hit a red component.
- Slide that component into the socket; paint traversed cells black.
- Unmatched reds vanish.

Key insight: Docking direction is inferred by ray-casting from interior sockets to the nearest red component.

Transfer sprites from red-marked lanes to green-marked lanes, recoloring and stacking.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Red (2) and green (3) thin bars define vertical lanes.
- Each lane contains repeated identical monochrome sprites in an evenly spaced vertical grid.

Rule:
- Each red lane's sprites turn grey (5); their count transfers to the nearest green lane.
- New sprites fill empty lattice slots bottom-up, using the source shape recolored to the destination lane's sprite color.
- All marker bars are removed.

Key insight: Sprite count is conserved across lanes — red sprites become grey, and equally many new sprites stack into the green lane's regular grid.

Move every object above the solid bottom stripe upward by its own pixel count.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, exactly one full-width non-background row
that acts as a fixed stripe, and one or more 4-connected monochrome objects
above that stripe.

Rule
Clear each object from its original cells, then translate it straight upward
by the number of pixels in that object, preserving its shape and color. Leave
the full-width stripe unchanged.

Key insight
Each object's area is also its vertical displacement; the full-width row is a
fixed baseline, not a moving object.

<description>
Pack each solid foreground rectangle twice: wide across the top and tall from the bottom.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and one foreground color; the foreground forms
separate solid rectangles, ordered from left to right.

Rule
Build a 10-row background canvas whose width is the packed width of the wide
versions of the rectangles. For each source rectangle, paint a top-aligned
rectangle of shape min(h,w) by max(h,w), with one background column between
consecutive rectangles. Then, starting again from the left edge, paint a
bottom-aligned rectangle of shape max(h,w) by min(h,w) for each source rectangle,
again separated by one background column.

Key insight
The input rectangles are not copied in their original orientations; each object
contributes one horizontal-facing and one vertical-facing normalized rectangle,
preserving left-to-right object order.

<description>
Move magenta particles along corridors formed by parallel colored bars.

Input structure:
- bg=7. Particles=6 in col 0. Colored bars on even rows form corridors on odd rows.

Rule:
- Particle goes straight through bg cells.
- When blocked by a colored cell, turns 90° into the perpendicular direction
  that has a bg cell flanked by same-color bars. Stops at grid edge or full blockage.

Key insight: Same-color parallel bars define the only valid corridors, so each particle follows a deterministic local trace.

<description>
Combine each column's repeated template mask with its single solid color swatch.

Input structure:
- The grid is a table of framed panels separated by background rows/columns.
- The leftmost column gives one solid row-label color for each panel row.
- In each panel column, exactly one panel has a solid non-background interior,
  while the other panels share the same mask drawn in one template color on
  the background.

Rule:
- For every panel column, find the row containing the solid interior swatch.
- Rebuild one output panel using that row's left label as the frame color.
- Fill the repeated template mask with the swatch color and leave the mask
  background cells as background; separate rebuilt panels with one
  background column.

Key insight:
The table encodes a colorized stencil per column: the solid panel supplies
the paint color and frame label, while the duplicate template panels supply
the shape mask.

<description>
Paint the inner foreground color into every background pixel that touches the enclosing frame only diagonally.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color is an enclosing frame: its bbox strictly contains the bbox of the other, inner color.

Rule:
- Keep all existing pixels unchanged.
- For each background pixel, if it is diagonally adjacent to the frame color and has no orthogonal adjacency to the frame color, recolor it to the inner color.

Key insight: The inner color marks the color to use, while the frame's diagonal-only background neighbors define the cells to add.

Extend diagonal rays outward from outer-border segments adjacent to diamond shapes on a checkerboard.

Input structure:
- Checkerboard bg (two most common colors).
- Hollow diamond outlines (8-pixel) in a non-bg color (inner border).
- Short diagonal line segments in another non-bg color adjacent to each diamond edge (outer border).

Rule:
- For each outer-border segment, determine the outward direction (perpendicular to the segment, away from the diamond).
- From each endpoint of the segment, cast a diagonal ray outward, painting over bg pixels with the segment's color until hitting a non-bg pixel or the grid edge.

Key insight: Rays emit only from the two endpoints of each outer-border segment, not every pixel, and travel diagonally away from the diamond.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

<description>
Summarize the enclosed table slots by the single object color inside each slot, using the slot background color for empty slots.

Input structure
- The most common color forms the outer background and all enclosed slot
  backgrounds.
- The enclosed background components form a complete rectangular array of
  slots, ordered by their positions.
- Each slot contains either no other color or exactly one object color.

Rule
- Find all 4-connected components of the most common color that do not touch
  the input edge.
- Sort their bounding boxes into row and column order to define the output
  table.
- For each slot, output its unique non-background color if present; otherwise
  output the background color.

Key insight
- The large grid is an expanded table: the enclosed background components are
  the cells, and any colored object drawn inside a cell is that cell's summary
  value.

Convert each hollow 3x3 symbol to one pixel and slide the pixels clockwise from the marked edge.

Input structure
- The grid has a background, one full-edge marker line, and monochrome hollow 3x3 foreground symbols.
- The symbols lie on a coarse row/column lattice; fully empty lattice rows or columns are absent from the output.

Rule
- Replace each hollow 3x3 symbol with one pixel of its color in the corresponding coarse-grid cell.
- The marker edge gives the compaction direction by clockwise border travel: top -> right, right -> down, bottom -> left, left -> up.
- Preserve the order of non-background pixels while sliding them as far as possible in that direction.

Key insight
- The large picture is a scaled symbolic grid, and the blue edge marker acts as a gravity direction rather than as output content.

Extract the unique cell from each lattice row into a single-column lattice.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into equal square cells by uniform gridlines of color L.
- Cell interiors filled with bg; each cell has an inner sprite pattern.
- Each row of cells has exactly one cell with a unique pattern; the rest are copies.

Rule:
- For each lattice row, find the cell whose inner pattern appears exactly once (the "odd one out").
- Construct a single-column lattice preserving the original row heights, containing only the unique cells.

Key insight: The task is per-row "odd one out" — every cell in a row is identical except one oddball, which must be extracted.

Reverse the sequence of colors along the single 4-connected foreground path while keeping the path shape fixed.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- All non-background pixels form one multicolor 4-connected one-pixel-wide path.
- The path has exactly two endpoints and no branches.

Rule:
- Walk the path from one endpoint to the other.
- Replace the colors on those same path cells by the original path colors in reverse order.
- Leave every background pixel unchanged.

Key insight:
- Nothing moves geometrically; only the color string written on the path is reversed between the endpoints.

<description>
Trace diagonal rays from triangular arrows, reflecting off colored wall pixels.

Input structure:
- bg grid with monochrome 3-pixel L-shaped "arrows" (2x2 bbox missing one corner) and scattered colored wall pixels.

Rule:
- Each arrow fires a ray diagonally away from its missing corner, painting bg cells in its color.
- A head-on wall hit reverses both axes; a side-touch wall hit flips the touched axis only.
- On any bounce the ray adopts the wall's color and recolors the contact cell.
- Ray stops when it exits the grid or reaches another arrow.

Key insight: Two distinct reflection types (corner vs side-touch) plus color inheritance at each bounce drive the path geometry.

Recolor a path-network by adjacent seed regions.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Path color P forms a thin orthogonal network with a solid square hub (NxN).
- Seed colors appear in colored regions (non-bg, non-P) adjacent to path branches.

Rule:
- Infer P as the non-bg color whose largest component is most network-like.
- Find the largest solid k×k all-P square (the hub); exclude it from recoloring.
- Recolor each path branch to the seed-region color it touches most.
- Recolor the hub center pixel to the seed whose branches touch the hub most.

Key insight: The hub stays uncolored; branches inherit color from adjacent seed regions by adjacency count.

Count colored objects and record tallies inside a legend box.

Input structure:
- A black rectangular legend box with key-color pixels in its leftmost non-black column.
- Outside the box, distinct objects of each key color are scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- For each key color, count separate same-colored objects outside the legend box.
- Output the legend box repainted: each key row gets one dot per object, spaced every other cell rightward from the key pixel.

Key insight: The legend is both the color index and the output canvas — object counts become dot sequences on the matching row.

Sort vertical bars by height and redistribute them across fixed colored slots.

Input structure:
- bg background; a horizontal base line of a single color spans the full grid width.
- Several monochrome vertical bars of distinct colors rise upward from the base line.

Rule:
- Rank bar shapes by height (shortest to tallest).
- Rank original x-positions (slots) left to right.
- Place the i-th shortest shape into the i-th leftmost slot, recoloring it to that slot's original color.
- The base line is preserved unchanged.

Key insight: Each slot keeps its x-position and color identity; only the bar silhouettes are redistributed among slots by height order.

<description>
Connect framed squares via colored bridges following a control-pixel sequence.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Border color forms equal-sized framed squares with unique inner fill colors.
- Control row below squares: colored pixels read left-to-right encode visitation order.

Rule:
- Start at the square matching first control color c0.
- For each consecutive pair (ci, ci+1), find the ci+1-colored square aligned in the same row or column band, preferring nearest.
- Draw a bridge colored ci between the pair, spanning the gap with inner-square thickness.

Key insight: Row/column-band alignment plus proximity resolves ambiguity when inner colors repeat.

Copy colored control-ray ports from one rectangular sprite orientation to every matching transformed sprite.

Input structure:
- bg is the most common color.
- Several dense 2-by-N or N-by-2 rectangular sprites are dihedral transforms of one template.
- Isolated single-pixel control markers sit on rays projected outward from the dominant long edge of some sprites.

Rule:
- For each sprite, the active edge is the long side whose cells have the strongest same-color majority.
- A control marker seen first along an outward ray from an active-edge cell assigns its color to that template cell.
- On every transformed sprite, draw that assigned color outward from the corresponding active-edge cell through bg cells until blocked or out of bounds.

Key insight:
- The marker positions are not absolute; they label cells of a shared rectangular template, then the labels follow each sprite's rotation/reflection.

Extract the hidden two-color image by compacting the rows and columns of its complete mask.

Input structure
The grid contains one pair of colors whose pixels occupy every cell in the
cross product of their active rows and active columns; all other colors form
the surrounding filler or separators.
Rule
Find that unique color pair, keep exactly the rows and columns touched by
the pair, and return the induced subgrid.
Key insight
The target image is not chosen by color id; it is the only two-color mask
whose occupied pixels form a full rectangular row/column product after
deleting unused rows and columns.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
