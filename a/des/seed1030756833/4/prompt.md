Extend the diagonal blue ray through the grid, reflecting it off red line-segment mirrors.

Input structure
- Black-background grid with one diagonal 8-connected blue ray seed.
- Red foreground objects, when present, are straight horizontal or vertical mirror segments.
- Other foreground bars are transparent to the ray and may be overwritten where the ray crosses them.

Rule
- Start from the ray seed endpoint whose outward diagonal extension remains inside the grid.
- Paint the ray continuously in that diagonal direction until it leaves the grid.
- If the next cell is a red mirror, do not paint it; reflect by flipping the row direction on a horizontal mirror or the column direction on a vertical mirror.

Key insight
- The non-red bars are decoys: only red bars reflect the diagonal path, while all other crossed cells become blue.

Predict the next panel in a framed sequence by continuing each scheduled colored interval.

Input structure
- The grid is made from three or more equal panels in one row or one column.
- The final input panel is the static target template; every earlier panel differs from it only by dynamic colors absent from the template.
- Each dynamic color appears in a regular temporal schedule across the earlier panels.

Rule
- Keep the final template panel as the output canvas.
- For every dynamic color whose schedule reaches the next panel, compare its last two appearances.
- Extrapolate each one-dimensional interval along the color's changing row or column axis and paint that predicted mask.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for the last visible panel, but for the next frame after the blank/template slot.

Paint the inner foreground color into every background pixel that touches the enclosing frame only diagonally.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color is an enclosing frame: its bbox strictly contains the bbox of the other, inner color.

Rule:
- Keep all existing pixels unchanged.
- For each background pixel, if it is diagonally adjacent to the frame color and has no orthogonal adjacency to the frame color, recolor it to the inner color.

Key insight: The inner color marks the color to use, while the frame's diagonal-only background neighbors define the cells to add.

<description>
Swap paired marker pixels across the largest foreground-color barrier, placing them just outside the barrier segment.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color is the unique most frequent non-background color; its pixels form the stationary barrier.
- Other foreground pixels are single markers, sometimes paired on opposite sides of one contiguous barrier segment in the same row or column.

Rule:
- Scan each row and column that crosses exactly one contiguous barrier segment.
- If the line has exactly one marker on each side of that segment, erase both source markers and place each marker in the cell immediately beyond the opposite side of the segment.
- Lines with markers on only one side are unchanged; the barrier remains unchanged.

Key insight:
- The marker pairing is local to a row or column, and the destination is defined by the nearest cells outside the intervening barrier segment, not by the original distance from the barrier.

Emit four teal beams from a square, turning at colored obstacles per a legend.

Input structure:
- Top band: grey (5) legend with colored vertical bars in cells; bar position (left or right) encodes turn direction.
- Below: main grid with bg, a solid teal (8) square, and colored obstacle blocks.

Rule:
- Remove the legend from the output.
- From the teal square, shoot a beam in each cardinal direction (as a sliding copy of the square).
- Each beam paints teal over bg cells as it moves.
- On hitting an obstacle of color C, consult the legend: bar on left → turn counterclockwise, bar on right → turn clockwise. Continue in the new direction.
- Beams stop at grid edges.

Key insight: The legend's bar position (left vs right within its cell) is the encoding for turn direction at each obstacle color.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

Transfer each colored marker to its adjacent neutral mask component, then erase the markers.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color.
- The neutral mask color is the unique most frequent foreground color.
- Other foreground colors are marker pixels that may touch neutral 4-connected mask components.
Rule
- Remove every marker pixel by recoloring it to the background.
- For each 4-connected neutral mask component, find marker colors touching it by edge adjacency.
- If a component touches one marker color, recolor the whole neutral component to that marker color.
- If a component touches no marker color, leave it neutral.
Key insight
- Marker pixels label neighboring neutral regions but are not part of the final colored objects.

Fill hollow sprites' interiors using a color-palette legend on the grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Several hollow sprites with distinct border colors.
- A small 2×N or N×2 palette block sits on one grid edge; one row/column lists border colors, the other lists corresponding fill colors.

Rule:
- Locate the palette legend on a grid edge and read it as a border→fill color mapping.
- Find enclosed bg regions (holes) inside sprites that don't touch the grid boundary.
- For each hole, identify the most common adjacent border color, look it up in the palette, and fill the hole with the mapped fill color.

Key insight: The palette's edge position and orientation determine reading direction; border colors in the palette uniquely key into fill colors.

Fit a grey bar into a grey frame by aligning projections with colored columns, then stack colors above.

Input structure:
- bg, a grey structural color forming two components: a large rectangular frame (slot) and a smaller bar with upward projections.
- Colored pixels inside the slot mark target columns.

Rule:
- Move the bar upward into the slot so its bottom edge sits one cell above the slot's interior bottom.
- Shift it horizontally so the bar's upward projections align column-wise with the colored pixels in the slot.
- Stack the colored pixels immediately above the bar projections in each column.

Key insight: The bar's projections act as keys that must align with the colored-column "locks" in the slot.

Fire projectiles from 3-pixel triangle sprites; mark collisions with maroon or blue.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg 3-pixel sprites shaped as axis-aligned L's or diagonal V's.

Rule:
- Each triangle has an apex and an emission direction determined by its shape: L-shapes fire diagonally away from the missing corner; V-shapes fire along the axis away from the open side.
- A projectile lands exactly 5 cells from the apex in the emission direction.
- If it hits an existing sprite, that entire sprite is recolored to maroon (9).
- If two projectiles land on the same empty cell, that cell becomes blue (1); a lone projectile on empty bg paints maroon (9).

Key insight: The triangle's orientation encodes both direction and target; dual-projectile collisions on open bg produce blue, not maroon.

Grow an alternating pink/orange triangular trace downward from the horizontal orange seed row.

Input structure:
- The grid has a green background and one horizontal row containing all orange foreground pixels.
- The seed row may contain isolated orange pixels and adjacent orange runs.
- Pink is absent from the input and is used for the first generated row.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- Two rows below the current active row, place a child pixel between each active pair
  whose middle cell in the current row is background.
- Alternate generated row colors between pink and orange, stopping when no children
  can be generated or the next row would leave the grid.

Key insight:
- Only an active-background-active triplet in the current row reproduces; contiguous
  active runs do not produce children through occupied middle cells.

Crop the largest object and overlay each smaller sprite where its shared marker pattern matches.

Input structure
- The background is the most common color, and the foreground has one largest destination object plus smaller source sprites.
- Each source sprite shares exactly one marker color with the destination object.

Rule
- Output the tight bbox crop of the largest object.
- Translate each source sprite so every connected marker component of the shared color exactly matches destination marker components.
- Paste source sprites in decreasing area order, so smaller sprites can sit on top of larger ones when they overlap.

Key insight
- The shared-color marker components are alignment keys; matching whole marker components distinguishes singleton slots from larger same-color marker blocks.

Move bordered 5×5 squares to their designated grid edges by border color.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Azure (8) and red (2) bordered 5×5 squares with colored interiors, scattered across the grid.

Rule:
- Azure squares → left edge (col 0); red squares → right edge (col W−5).
- Each square keeps its original row.
- Process azure left-to-right, red right-to-left (nearest-to-edge first).
- If a square's rows overlap an already-placed edge square, place it one square-width inward instead.

Key insight: Near-edge-first ordering plus row-overlap determines which square sits at the edge vs. the second column.

Extend marker tiles outward from '+' shapes by repeating them to the grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- A dominant non-bg color forms several '+'-shaped objects.
- Small colored patches (1–few cells) sit adjacent to each arm of a '+'.

Rule:
- For each marker tile touching a '+', determine which side of the '+' it sits on.
- Project the tile away from the '+' in that direction, repeating the tile pattern periodically until the grid boundary.
- '+' pixels are never overwritten.

Key insight: Each marker's attachment side determines its extension direction; the pattern repeats periodically, not as a single copy.

Move bordered containers toward same-colored destination markers, charging gray cells to orange.

Input structure:
- bg = 6 (magenta). Black-bordered (0) rectangles with gray (5) / orange (7) interiors.
- A head sprite (9) sits adjacent to one container edge; a matching destination sprite lies along the movement axis.

Rule:
- Each container translates toward its destination along the head-to-dest axis.
- Steps = min(head-to-dest distance, number of gray interior cells).
- Gray cells become orange from the head-facing side inward, one per step.

Key insight: Gray cell count caps movement — a container stops short if it runs out of gray cells to charge.

Rewrite a corner L block into two nested L borders and a diagonal trace.

Input structure
A rectangular grid has exactly two colors: one color forms a one-cell-thick
L on two adjacent outer edges, and the other color fills the remaining
rectangle.

Rule
Normalize the L to the top-left corner. Paint the outer top-left L with the
fill color, the next inner L with the original border color, and the main
diagonal of the remaining inner rectangle with the fill color. All other
cells become color 8, then the original orientation is restored.

Key insight
The corner of the input L determines the orientation; after flipping to a
canonical top-left L, the output is the same nested-layer pattern for every
example.

Complete each boundary tab or notch by adding the complementary feature on the opposite side of the foreground object.

Input structure
- The grid has exactly two colors: a dominant background and one foreground object.
- The foreground object is a thick rectilinear shape with one-pixel tabs and notches on its boundary.

Rule
- A foreground tab is a one-neighbor boundary pixel; project through its full row or column span and remove the opposite edge pixel to make a matching notch.
- A background notch is a one-pixel cut with three foreground 4-neighbors; project across the full row or column span and add a tab just outside the opposite edge.
- Notches immediately beside a tab source are not independent sources, because that gap belongs to the tab's local boundary shape.

Key insight
- The changed pixels are not color-specific noise; they are paired jigsaw-like boundary features on opposite sides of the same thick row or column cross-section.

Complete sparse nested rectangular color layers into solid rectangles.

Input structure
The background is the dominant color, and every foreground color marks one
axis-aligned rectangular layer; the layer bboxes have unique areas and are
nested from outermost to innermost.
Rule
Take each color's bbox as its completed rectangle, except that a child bbox
which already matches at least three sides of its parent's one-pixel inset
expands to that full inset; repaint the rectangles largest to smallest.
Key insight
The scattered pixels are samples of nested rectangular regions, so the
output is a clean redraw of those regions with inner colors overwriting
outer colors.

Push every colored object touching maroon markers straight outward until it reaches the grid edge.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Maroon pixels are fixed markers.
- Every other foreground 4-connected object touches the marker pixels on exactly one cardinal side.

Rule:
- Clear each non-background, non-maroon object from its original position.
- Translate it in the direction away from its maroon contact until the object reaches the grid boundary.
- Keep the maroon marker pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The maroon contact side is a launcher: it determines a unique outward ray for the whole object, and the edge of the grid determines the translation distance.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
