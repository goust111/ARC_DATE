Compress each colored ray pixel inward until it touches that color's 3x3 anchor block.
Input structure
- A uniform background grid with non-background colors.
- Each foreground color contains one solid 3x3 anchor block; all other pixels of that color lie on straight 8-neighbor rays aimed at that block.
Rule
- Keep anchor blocks fixed, erase loose foreground pixels, and for each ray pack its pixels into consecutive cells adjacent to the anchor along the same ray.
Key insight
- The scattered pixels are displaced pixels on visible row, column, or diagonal sightlines back to their same-colored 3x3 block.

Recolor wall-separated background regions alternately, starting with grey in the lower-left region.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground wall color.
- The wall pixels form one or more 4-connected one-cell-thick segments.
- Each wall segment separates exactly two 4-connected background regions.
Rule
- Keep all wall pixels unchanged.
- Label the 4-connected background regions and connect two labels when they
  touch opposite sides of the same wall segment.
- Color the region containing the lower-left corner grey, then flip between
  grey and green across every wall adjacency.
Key insight
- The red walls define a bipartite map of regions; the lower-left background
  region fixes which side of the alternating coloring is grey.

Shift alternating two-color row bars so each row aligns to the topmost bar's color columns.

Input structure:
- The dominant background surrounds horizontal two-pixel bars.
- Every foreground row has exactly one adjacent bar using the same two colors.
- The topmost bar gives the reference left/right column for each color.

Rule:
- Keep bars whose left color is already in its reference column.
- For a reversed bar, shift the whole two-pixel bar horizontally until its
  left color lands in that color's reference column.
- Background cells vacated by shifted bars become background.

Key insight:
- The rows are not recolored; each two-color bar is translated so equal
  colors line up with the topmost reference bar.

Fill rectangular cavities in a template shape by placing source sprites into matching holes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. A dominant "base" color forms a large frame/template with rectangular gaps.
- Small colored sprites sit outside the template region.

Rule:
- The base color (largest connected component excluding bg) defines the template bbox.
- Each rectangular hole inside the template matches exactly one outside sprite by size.
- Place each sprite into its matching cavity; output is the filled template bbox.

Key insight: Sprite bounding boxes match cavity dimensions exactly — it's a jigsaw-fit puzzle where each piece has a unique slot.

<description>
Copy each marked sprite to every standalone marker of the same color and erase the original sources.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each source is an 8-connected component containing a monochrome sprite and one marker pixel of another color.
- Other isolated marker pixels may be destinations; marker colors with no source sprite are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the grid to background.
- For every source marker color, place the sprite at each other marker of that color using the source marker as the anchor.
- Keep each destination marker pixel in place; do not keep source sprites, source markers, or distractor markers.

Key insight:
- A colored marker is not part of the sprite geometry; it is the anchor that says where same-colored copies of that sprite should be stamped.

Invert each row's native foreground color against the black background.

Input structure
- A black-background grid whose rows each have one native foreground color plus optional distractor colors.
- The native row color is the most frequent non-bg color in that row; if tied, its run starts leftmost among tied colors.

Rule
- For each row independently, turn pixels of the native row color into bg.
- Turn every other pixel in that row, including bg and distractor colors, into the native row color.

Key insight
- Distractor colors are not preserved objects; they mark cells that participate in the binary complement of the row's native color.

Extend the edge-touching green start bar through the corridor, turning at each teal blocker until the path leaves the grid.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: a 2-pixel 4-connected start bar and many blocker pixels.
- Exactly one pixel of the start bar lies on the grid border.

Rule:
- Start from the border pixel of the bar and move through the other bar pixel into the grid.
- Paint every traversed non-blocker pixel with the start color.
- When the next cell is a blocker, turn to the unique perpendicular non-blocker neighbor; when the next cell is outside the grid, stop.

Key insight: The blocker pixels define a one-cell-wide corridor, so every interior collision has exactly one valid 90-degree turn.

Reorder 5×5 blocks into a connected strip by matching edge foreground pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = background; sep = divider color (full row/column lines).
- Several 5×5 sprite blocks in a grid, separated by sep lines.

Rule:
- Two blocks "connect" when their facing edges share foreground pixels at the same offset (e.g., A's right edge ∩ B's left edge).
- Chain all blocks in the orientation (horizontal or vertical) that admits a complete sequence.
- Output is a 1×N strip of blocks in chain order, separated by sep lines.

Key insight: Edge-contact overlap determines both block ordering and output orientation.

Turn black dents in two colored regions into marked opposite-color patches.

Input structure:
- Black background with two large foreground colors.
- The large regions contain small black dents and a few one-cell color specks
  or protrusions along region boundaries.

Rule:
- Locally clean the two foreground regions: isolated specks become black, and
  one-cell protrusions surrounded by the other region take that region's color.
- Each original black dent whose cleaned 3x3 neighborhood is mostly one
  foreground color becomes the center of a 3x3 patch in the opposite color.
- The dent center itself is recolored teal (8).

Key insight: The teal pixels mark the original black defects; the surrounding
3x3 patch uses the other foreground color, after first removing boundary noise.

Crop the foreground object whose missing cells match marker shapes, and fill those missing cells with the marker colors.

Input structure
A dominant background surrounds several monochromatic foreground objects. Exactly one object has background gaps inside its bounding box whose component shapes are matched by separate marker objects.
Rule
Find that object, crop its bounding box, and replace each background gap component with the color of the separate marker component or components having the same normalized shape.
Key insight
The marker objects do not mark absolute positions; their shapes identify which gaps in the selected object should be colored, while objects with unmatched gaps are distractors.

Move every object above the solid bottom stripe upward by its own pixel count.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, exactly one full-width non-background row
that acts as a fixed stripe, and one or more 4-connected monochrome objects
above that stripe.

Rule
Clear each object from its original cells, then translate it straight upward
by the number of pixels in that object, preserving its shape and color. Leave
the full-width stripe unchanged.

Key insight
Each object's area is also its vertical displacement; the full-width row is a
fixed baseline, not a moving object.

Emit four teal beams from a square, turning at colored obstacles per a legend.

Input structure:
- Top band: grey (5) legend with colored vertical bars in cells; bar position (left or right) encodes turn direction.
- Below: main grid with bg, a solid teal (8) square, and colored obstacle blocks.

Rule:
- Remove the legend from the output.
- From the teal square, shoot a beam in each cardinal direction (as a sliding copy of the square).
- Each beam paints teal over bg cells as it moves.
- On hitting an obstacle of color C, consult the legend: bar on left → turn counterclockwise, bar on right → turn clockwise. Continue in the new direction.
- Beams stop at grid edges.

Key insight: The legend's bar position (left vs right within its cell) is the encoding for turn direction at each obstacle color.

Slide each black border rectangle to the opposite border, recoloring its swept stripe orange and leaving the rectangle black at the far edge.

Input structure
- The grid contains black rectangular 4-connected masks, each touching exactly one outer border.
- Grey cells form incidental pattern content; orange is the trail color used when a black mask slides.

Rule
- Treat all black rectangles as moving simultaneously.
- A rectangle touching the top or bottom edge moves vertically to the opposite edge in the same columns.
- A rectangle touching the left or right edge moves horizontally to the opposite edge in the same rows.
- Recolor the complete swept row or column stripe to orange, then stamp every destination rectangle in black.

Key insight
- Edge contact gives the slide direction; the output is the set of opposite-edge black rectangles plus their orange trails.

Fill partitioned regions with concentric colored bands derived from marker pixels.

Input structure:
- Grid partitioned into regions by wall-colored lines.
- Each region has a dominant base color and a few isolated marker pixels of other colors at varying depths from the region boundary.

Rule:
- For each region, read marker colors ordered by their Chebyshev distance from the boundary to build a color palette.
- If no marker sits on the boundary itself, the base color leads the palette.
- Paint every cell with palette[distance mod palette_length], producing repeating concentric rectangular frames that radiate inward.

Key insight: Each marker's depth from the boundary defines its position in the cyclic palette; the pattern then tiles inward automatically.

Align parallel colored line segments so they all share the same start and end positions as a reference line.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several parallel line segments (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical), each a different color, running in the same direction but starting/ending at different positions.

Rule:
- Detect the dominant direction shared by all segments.
- Pick the median segment (by perpendicular offset) as the reference.
- Shift every segment along the shared direction so its start aligns with the reference's start, then trim or extend it to match the reference's length.
- Grid size stays the same; isolated single pixels are untouched.

Key insight: The reference is the median line, not the longest; all segments are snapped to its extent regardless of their original length.

Align a central rectangle to two colored frame-edge controls via rotation/reflection.

Input structure:
- bg grid with two solid-colored border edges (distinct non-bg colors).
- A central filled rectangle with 1px colored guide edges on two sides, colors matching the frame controls.

Rule:
- Rotate/mirror the object so its guide edges face the same sides as the matching frame controls.
- Crop off the 1px guide edges from aligned sides.

Key insight: Guide-edge colors encode target frame sides; the correct dihedral transform matches both simultaneously.

Remove the left control column and roll the remaining image downward by the red marker's row.

Input structure
- The input is a rectangular grid with a one-cell-wide control column on the left.
- That control column is all pink except for exactly one red marker pixel.
- The columns to the right are the image that remains in the output.

Rule
- Delete the left control column.
- Let r be the row index of the red marker in that column.
- Cyclically shift the remaining image downward by r rows.

Key insight
- The red marker's vertical position encodes the row-roll amount; the pink
  column is only a control strip and is removed after reading it.

Replicate a motif across quadrants with scaling and reflection keyed to red anchor blocks.

Input structure:
- Grid divided into four quadrants by a full-row and full-column divider of a single non-bg color.
- Each quadrant contains a red (2) square anchor block of varying size.
- The top-left quadrant also has a colored motif attached to its red anchor.

Rule:
- Use the top-left quadrant's motif as the source pattern.
- For each other quadrant, scale the motif by the ratio of that quadrant's red block size to the source red block size.
- Reflect horizontally for right-side quadrants, vertically for bottom quadrants (both for bottom-right).
- Align the scaled/reflected motif so its red region overlaps the target anchor, then stamp non-bg pixels.

Key insight: Red block size encodes the scale factor; quadrant position encodes the reflection axes.

Render the filled-square object counts as compact nested stacks ordered by count rank.

Input structure
A large noisy grid has a dominant background, scattered non-square noise, and
filled monochrome square objects. Each square side length has exactly one
object color, and side lengths form consecutive sizes.

Rule
Ignore non-square components. If the lowest square in the scene is of the
smallest side length, treat that one smallest square as a distractor and do
not count it. For count rank k from left to right, create one block from all
square sizes with at least k remaining objects; draw larger squares first and
smaller squares over their upper-left corner, then append one background
separator column.

Key insight
The output is a count histogram of square side lengths, but each histogram
slot is rendered as nested upper-left square masks using the side colors.

Rotate each blue-started chain of bottom-aligned vertical bars into horizontal bars resting on the same baseline.
Input structure
- The grid has a background and bottom-aligned, one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Blue bars are markers; red bars are body bars that may be chained after a marker.
Rule
- Starting at each blue bar, repeatedly include the next red bar whose column is exactly the current bar's column plus the current bar's height.
- Clear every included vertical bar, then redraw each included bar horizontally to the right from its original bottom cell, with length equal to its vertical height.
- Red bars that are not reached from a blue marker remain unchanged.
Key insight
- A vertical bar's height is also the width it occupies after rotation, so the chain follows immediate horizontal contact after each rotated bar.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
