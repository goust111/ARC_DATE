Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

Repeat the bottom foreground motif upward until it fills the whole grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground pixels occupy a contiguous block of rows at the bottom.
- That bottom block is the complete vertical motif, including its background cells.

Rule
- Copy the bottom motif rows repeatedly upward across the full grid.
- Preserve horizontal alignment and vertical phase: the original first motif row remains at its input row.
- The output shape is unchanged.

Key insight
The blank rows above the bottom foreground block are missing repetitions of the same row motif, not empty space.

Paint an inner border around the region reachable from a corner marker pixel.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color; wall color (blue) forms barriers dividing the grid.
- A unique single pixel (magenta) sits on one corner — the start marker.
- Some wall-colored pixels are structural (border-touching, enclosing regions); others are decorations.

Rule:
- Flood-fill from the marker corner to find all reachable bg cells, blocked by structural walls.
- Erase wall-colored decorations hidden behind structural walls (not reachable from marker side).
- Paint orange (color 7) on every reachable bg cell adjacent to a wall or grid edge — forming a 1-cell inner border.

Key insight: Only border-connected wall components act as real barriers; interior wall fragments are decorations to be removed.

<description>
Grow an alternating pink/orange triangular trace downward from the horizontal orange seed row.

Input structure:
- The grid has a green background and one horizontal row containing all orange foreground pixels.
- The seed row may contain isolated orange pixels and adjacent orange runs.
- Pink is absent from the input and is used for the first generated row.

Rule:
- Copy the input grid.
- Two rows below the current active row, place a child pixel between each active pair
  whose middle cell in the current row is background.
- Alternate generated row colors between pink and orange, stopping when no children
  can be generated or the next row would leave the grid.

Key insight:
- Only an active-background-active triplet in the current row reproduces; contiguous
  active runs do not produce children through occupied middle cells.

<description>
Move the diagonal foreground segment to the next longer run along the same up-right diagonal.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and one foreground color. The foreground pixels form a
contiguous one-pixel-wide segment on a single anti-diagonal.

Rule
Erase the current segment. If its columns are c0..c1 and its length is L, draw the same
color on columns c1+1..c1+L+1 along the same anti-diagonal.

Key insight
The segment advances past its current upper-right end by one whole segment position, and
the next segment is one pixel longer than the current one.

Build nested square frames from a stack of horizontal color stripes.

Input structure:
- Full-width horizontal stripes of distinct non-bg colors, stacked vertically.
- Each stripe has uniform color and variable height (1-4 rows).

Rule:
- Read stripes bottom to top.
- Bottom stripe becomes the center solid square with side length = stripe height.
- Each subsequent stripe wraps the current shape with a square frame of thickness = stripe height, in that stripe's color.

Key insight: Stripe height doubles as both frame thickness and (for the innermost) center-square side length; output dimensions are fully determined by the stripe heights.

<description>
Fill rectangles between diagonal marker pairs using a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg grid with a vertical legend at the bottom-left: each row is a (marker_color, fill_color) pair.
- Scattered L-shaped corner markers of each marker color define opposite corners of axis-aligned rectangles.
- Some markers are solid 2×2 blocks instead of corner pairs.

Rule:
- Read legend bottom-to-top; for each entry find all pixels of that marker color.
- Determine which two bbox corners carry L-shaped anchors — the *other* diagonal defines the fill region.
- Fill the diamond (all shortest-path cells between those two corners) with the legend's fill color.
- Solid 2×2 marker blocks are simply recolored to the fill color.
- Later legend entries are protected from earlier fills.

Key insight: The L-shaped anchors sit on the marker diagonal; the fill goes on the opposite diagonal of the bounding box.

Fill holes inside a large template frame using shape-matched outside sprites.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. One large monochrome frame object (template).
- Inside the frame: holes of various shapes (non-frame-color regions).
- Outside the frame: small monochrome sprites scattered on bg.

Rule:
- Crop to the frame's bounding box; fill entirely with frame color.
- For each hole, find an outside sprite whose shape matches (rotation/flip allowed).
- Fill the hole with the matched sprite's color. If multiple sprites match, use the most frequent color.

Key insight: Sprites act as shape-coded color keys — their shape identifies which hole they fill, their color determines the fill color.

<description>
Move each gray marker along its green path until it reaches the cell next to a black-green-black gate, erasing the path behind it.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground components are made from a path color, a paired gate-end color, and single marker pixels.
- A gate is a straight end-center-end motif whose center has the path color and whose two ends share the gate-end color.

Rule:
- In every 4-connected foreground component with exactly one marker and one gate, erase the marker and all path-color pixels except the gate center.
- Place the marker on the unique path-color pixel adjacent to the gate center but not between the two gate ends.
- Components without both a marker and a gate stay unchanged.

Key insight: The black-green-black motif marks the stopping gate; the gray marker consumes the connected green path until it rests on the path cell immediately beside that gate.

Connect same-colored foreground components with one-cell-wide orthogonal paths around teal wall segments.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Teal cells are fixed wall segments and are never source connectors.
- Other foreground colors appear as one or more 4-connected components; colors with a single component stay unchanged.

Rule
- For each non-background, non-teal color, read its 4-connected components in row-major order.
- Connect each consecutive pair by the shortest clear L-shaped path between the two components.
- Clear paths may pass only through background or the same color, and they preserve the previous travel axis when both bends are possible.

Key insight
- The output is not a global recolor: each color traces a routed chain through its own components while teal cells and other colors act as blockers.

Summarize the foreground line objects as ordered horizontal color stripes.

Input structure:
- A dominant background fills a rectangular grid.
- Each non-background color forms one contiguous one-cell-thick line segment.
- The line segments have distinct topmost rows, and there are at most five of
  them.

Rule:
- Sort the foreground colors by the topmost row occupied by their line
  segment.
- Create a 5x3 output filled with the background color.
- Place one solid 1x3 row for each foreground color, preserving that
  top-to-bottom order and padding any unused rows above with background.

Key insight: The exact line length and slope do not matter; only the
vertical order of the colored line segments is encoded in the output stack.

Move the orange rectangle onto the maroon rectangle and mark gated corridor crossings in red.

Input structure
- The dominant background contains black obstacle segments.
- There is one solid orange rectangle and one solid maroon rectangle of the same size.
- The two rectangles share either their row span or their column span, so the move is straight and axis-aligned.

Rule
- Erase the original orange rectangle to the background.
- Replace the maroon rectangle with the orange rectangle.
- Between the two rectangles, paint red across the moving rectangle's width or height only at corridor cells flanked by black obstacle segments perpendicular to the movement.

Key insight
- The black segments define gates in the straight corridor; only those gated openings, not every swept background cell, become red.

Complete a grid of colored blocks to match a minimap legend in the top-left corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Top-left corner: a small sprite of single colored pixels forming a minimap pattern on a regular lattice.
- Main area: uniformly colored square blocks (NxN) arranged on a regular grid; some positions are empty (bg).

Rule:
- The legend pixels define a color pattern; each pixel's lattice position maps to a block position in the main grid via a fixed scale factor and offset.
- Existing colored blocks confirm the scale/offset alignment.
- For every legend pixel whose corresponding grid position is empty, place a new block of that color.

Key insight: The top-left pixel pattern is a scaled-down minimap of the block layout; the mapping is inferred from blocks already present.

Extend marker tiles outward from '+' shapes by repeating them to the grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- A dominant non-bg color forms several '+'-shaped objects.
- Small colored patches (1–few cells) sit adjacent to each arm of a '+'.

Rule:
- For each marker tile touching a '+', determine which side of the '+' it sits on.
- Project the tile away from the '+' in that direction, repeating the tile pattern periodically until the grid boundary.
- '+' pixels are never overwritten.

Key insight: Each marker's attachment side determines its extension direction; the pattern repeats periodically, not as a single copy.

Redraw foreground objects as nested square rings ordered by object size.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a 4-connected monochromatic component.
- Foreground object areas are distinct.

Rule:
- Sort the foreground objects by decreasing pixel count.
- Create a square output with side length 2 * number_of_objects - 1.
- The largest object color fills the outer ring, each next object color fills
  the next inner ring, and the smallest object color fills the center pixel.

Key insight: The objects' original shapes do not get copied; their areas
determine only the outside-to-inside order of the nested square pattern.

Erase all distractor pixels and expand the single red control pixel into the grid quadrant that contains it.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Exactly one red pixel is the control pixel.
- Other non-background pixels are distractors.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background color.
- Split the grid into equal top/bottom and left/right halves.
- Fill the quadrant containing the red control pixel with red.

Key insight:
- The red control pixel selects a whole half-grid quadrant by its row half and column half; all other foreground pixels are noise.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Carve color-matched motifs into solid blocks and pack them into a compact grid.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several solid 5×5 monochrome blocks, each a distinct non-bg color.
- For each block color, a small same-colored motif sprite elsewhere on the grid.

Rule:
- Match each motif to its same-colored 5×5 block.
- Center the motif within the block and recolor those cells to bg (punching holes).
- Pack all carved blocks into an output grid preserving their original row/column order, separated by 1-cell gaps and a 1-cell outer border.

Key insight: The motif acts as a stencil — it's not stamped onto the block but carved out of it as background holes.

Pack the non-background rows from three separated panels into one panel, scanning panels right-to-left.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid contains three equal-size panels separated by two full-height divider columns.
- The background is the dominant color; divider pixels use a color that appears only in the divider columns.

Rule:
- Read panels from right to left, and within each panel read rows from top to bottom.
- Keep each row that contains any non-background pixel, discarding all-background rows.
- Place the kept rows at the bottom of a single panel-shaped output, padding above with background rows.

Key insight:
- The task is row packing: the divider columns mark independent panels, and only the occupied rows are moved.

Use the left-edge color legend to draw a padded rectangular halo around each matching object while preserving enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- The grid has a dominant background color.
- One or more two-row markers sit on the left edge; each marker is a 2x2 block whose left column is an object color and right column is its halo color.
- Away from the markers, every source color from the legend appears as one or more 4-connected monochrome objects.

Rule:
- Keep the input pixels unchanged.
- For each source-color object, take its tight bbox expanded by one cell and clipped to the grid.
- Recolor background pixels in that expanded region to the marker's halo color, except for background holes enclosed by the object.

Key insight:
- The small left-edge bars are a legend: they map object colors to the colors used for the surrounding padded bbox.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
