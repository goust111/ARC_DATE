每个参考题描述包含：
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。

参考题目如下：

Fill the parallelogram-shaped region between parallel anti-diagonal line segments with red.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One non-bg color forms short diagonal segments, each lying on a single anti-diagonal (r+c = const).
- Segments come in parallel pairs bounding a region to be filled.

Rule:
- For each main-diagonal axis (r−c = const), collect anti-diagonal segments whose span covers that axis.
- Sort those segments by their anti-diagonal index (r+c).
- Fill all bg cells lying strictly between consecutive segment pairs along that axis with red (color 2).

Key insight: The two diagonal directions decouple — segments sit on anti-diagonals, and filling sweeps along main diagonals between them, forming parallelogram regions.

Slide each foreground object horizontally to the edge indicated by whether its shape has an open notch.

Input structure:
- Yellow is the background and there is one blue foreground color.
- The foreground is split into separated 4-connected objects.
- Each object keeps its row span and shape in the output.

Rule:
- If an object's bbox border contains a background gap flanked by object pixels along that same border, slide it to the right edge and recolor it green.
- Otherwise slide the object to the left edge and recolor it red.
- Start from a blank background canvas; no moved objects overlap.

Key insight:
- The target side is encoded by the object's shape, not by its original position: open notches go right, while closed or solid shapes go left.

Reorder and stack rectangles by proximity to two colored edge lines.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Two edge lines (h + v) meet at a corner marked by a unique color.
- "Blue" line is color 1 if present, else the longer line; other is "red."
- Solid rectangles in the interior.

Rule:
- Sort rectangles by (distance to blue edge, distance to red edge).
- If the blue edge is vertical, rotate each rectangle 90° CCW.
- Stack top-to-bottom, centered horizontally.

Key insight: Edge-line colors encode a coordinate system; proximity to each axis determines stacking order and rotation.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Crop out the grid half containing the two aligned marker pixels, then erase the markers to background.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background color and one non-background marker color
  that appears as exactly two cells.
- The marker cells are aligned either in one row or one column and both lie
  in the same half along that direction.
- Other non-background pixels are content inside one or both halves.

Rule
- If the markers share a row, keep the left or right half whose columns
  contain them.
- If the markers share a column, keep the top or bottom half whose rows
  contain them.
- In the kept half, recolor the marker pixels to the background color.

Key insight
- The two marker pixels are not part of the picture; their alignment and
  half-position identify which half of the doubled canvas is the answer.

Erase each target-color object crossed by the ray pointed by the bar-and-control marker.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is one three-pixel straight marker bar and one singleton control pixel adjacent to the bar center.
- The remaining non-background color forms multiple 4-connected target objects.

Rule:
- Cast a straight ray from the marker bar center in the direction away from the adjacent control pixel.
- Find every 4-connected target-color object that intersects that ray.
- Recolor all pixels of those hit target objects to the background; all other pixels stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- The whole object is erased when the center ray touches any of its pixels; the full marker bar width is not swept.

Fill each vertical foreground band's background cells with the color of the next band to its right.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each other color occupies a separate vertical band defined by that color's
  minimum and maximum columns.
- Within a band, all cells are either that band's color or background.

Rule
- Order the bands from left to right.
- In each band, replace background pixels with the color of the next band in
  that order, wrapping from the rightmost band back to the leftmost.
- Preserve all existing foreground pixels and all background pixels outside
  the bands.

Key insight
- The column bands form a cyclic palette legend: a band's gaps are completed
  by borrowing the color from its right-hand neighbor, not by changing the
  band's existing pixels.

Fill each black 5x5 region's missing interior positions with a fixed 3x3 positional color legend.

Input structure
- The grid uses teal as the dominant background and black for one or more
  5x5 regions.
- Each black region has a black one-pixel border and a 3x3 interior that
  may already contain teal pixels.

Rule
- Overlay the legend 1 7 6 / 4 8 5 / 2 9 3 on the 3x3 interior of every
  5x5 black region.
- Wherever an interior non-center legend position is still black, recolor it
  to the corresponding legend color; leave existing teal pixels, the center,
  and the black border unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored output pixels are not derived from the teal motif shape; they
  are the fixed position labels for the missing cells of each 3x3 interior.

<description>
Assemble the foreground objects by docking equal-colored boundary markers edge-to-edge.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and several 4-connected multicolor foreground
objects.  One foreground color is the body color; the less frequent foreground colors are
boundary connector markers, and each marker color appears once as a free end or twice as a
matched docking pair.

Rule
Crop each foreground object to its bounding box and translate the objects so that the two
occurrences of every paired connector color touch on their exposed boundary sides.  Preserve
each object's orientation and colors, then return the tight crop around the assembled
foreground on the original background color.

Key insight
The colored marker pixels are ports: matching colors specify which objects must touch, and
the marker's side of its object determines the direction of the translation.

Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Paint the teal outline of the right triangle determined by the missing corner of the grey-marker square.

Input structure
The grid is an orange background with exactly four foreground marker pixels of one color. The markers have a square bounding box: three markers are bbox corners, and the fourth marker is inside that square.
Rule
Find the one corner of the marker bounding square that has no marker. That missing corner is the right-angle vertex of a right isosceles triangle; paint its two axis-aligned legs and the opposite diagonal in teal, leaving existing marker pixels unchanged.
Key insight
The present corner marker opposite the missing corner is a decoy; the three triangle vertices are the missing corner and the two marker corners adjacent to it.

Move each marker from a lattice corner gap into the adjacent enclosed 12-pixel cavity.

Input structure:
- The grid is a repeated teal lattice around black 12-pixel cavities.
- A marker is a non-black pixel placed at the northwest corner gap of one
  complete 5x5 lattice tile; the marker may itself be teal.

Rule:
- For every marked northwest corner gap, clear that marker to black.
- Fill the 12 black pixels in the tile immediately down-right of the marker
  with the marker color.
- Leave the rest of the lattice unchanged.

Key insight:
- The apparent isolated markers are control pixels for the adjacent cavity;
  teal markers are recognized as extra teal pixels occupying a gap that the
  periodic lattice template says should be black.

Translate the colored objects into the most balanced complete rectangular frame.

Input structure
A grid with one dominant background color and several monochromatic
4-connected foreground objects that are straight bars or corner-like line
sprites.

Rule
Preserve every foreground object exactly, allowing translation only, and
place the objects so they cover every pixel of a one-cell-thick rectangular
frame exactly once; the frame interior is the background color.

Key insight
The output shape is not copied from the input: the foreground pixel count
determines possible frame sizes, and the intended output is the valid frame
assembly with the least difference between height and width.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Compress each colored ray pixel inward until it touches that color's 3x3 anchor block.
Input structure
- A uniform background grid with non-background colors.
- Each foreground color contains one solid 3x3 anchor block; all other pixels of that color lie on straight 8-neighbor rays aimed at that block.
Rule
- Keep anchor blocks fixed, erase loose foreground pixels, and for each ray pack its pixels into consecutive cells adjacent to the anchor along the same ray.
Key insight
- The scattered pixels are displaced pixels on visible row, column, or diagonal sightlines back to their same-colored 3x3 block.

Move magenta particles along corridors formed by parallel colored bars.

Input structure:
- bg=7. Particles=6 in col 0. Colored bars on even rows form corridors on odd rows.

Rule:
- Particle goes straight through bg cells.
- When blocked by a colored cell, turns 90° into the perpendicular direction
  that has a bg cell flanked by same-color bars. Stops at grid edge or full blockage.

Key insight: Same-color parallel bars define the only valid corridors, so each particle follows a deterministic local trace.

Complete each partially hidden simple foreground shape by recoloring the occluding pixels in its footprint.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several solid foreground shapes.
- Some shapes are partially hidden by other foreground colors, but their full
  footprint is still indicated by a foreground-filled bbox or by a foreground-
  filled 45-degree diagonal line.

Rule
- For each foreground color, complete its full rectangular bbox when that bbox
  contains no background and includes other colors.
- Otherwise, complete its 45-degree diagonal line when all visible pixels lie
  on that line and the hidden line cells are foreground, not background.
- Recolor only those hidden footprint pixels; leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The occluded cells are exactly the non-background cells inside a simple
  shape's implied footprint, so completing shapes is a local recoloring problem.

Split the two-color object horizontally, swap its colors, and slide the upper half to the right.

Input structure:
- The grid has one background color and exactly two foreground colors.
- All foreground pixels form one 4-connected object with an even-height bbox.
- The object has foreground pixels on both rows adjacent to its horizontal midpoint.

Rule:
- Split the object into upper and lower halves at the midpoint of its bbox.
- Swap the two foreground colors in both halves.
- Keep the lower half in place and shift the upper half right until its lower-left
  boundary pixel is diagonally adjacent to the lower half's upper-right boundary pixel.

Key insight:
- The object is not copied or reflected; it is broken at the horizontal waist,
  recolored by exchanging the two visible object colors, then rejoined diagonally.

Build a red ray network by activating blue blobs via directional green ports.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Large blue blobs with adjacent green pixels marking port directions.
- Start marker: yellow pixel atop a short red segment at grid bottom.

Rule:
- Extend a ray upward from start; on hitting a blue blob, recolor it red.
- Activated blobs emit thick rays through green ports until boundary or another blob.
- Cascade until no new blobs are reached.

Key insight: Green pixels encode ray direction and width; the network activates as a chain reaction from one start point.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
