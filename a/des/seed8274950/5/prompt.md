<description>
Recolor every pixel whose color is not one of the two most frequent input colors to orange.

Input structure:
- The grid contains at least three colors.
- Orange is absent from the input and is used only as the output replacement color.
- Exactly two colors occupy the top two frequency ranks; they may tie with each
  other, but no third color ties them at the cutoff.

Rule:
- Preserve every pixel whose color is one of the two most frequent input colors.
- Replace every other pixel with orange.

Key insight:
- The visible distinction is not the numeric identity of the colors but their
  population: the two majority colors remain, while all minority colors merge
  into the new orange color.

Compact the checkerboard's moving color toward the edge marked by the teal pixel, leaving a maroon swept trail on the marker line.

Input structure
- A blue/black checkerboard with exactly one teal marker replacing a blue pixel on a non-corner edge.
- The marker's checkerboard parity identifies the moving color (blue); the opposite parity is background (black).

Rule
- If the marker is on the left or right edge, compact moving-color pixels in every row toward that side.
- If the marker is on the top or bottom edge, compact moving-color pixels in every column toward that side.
- Preserve the teal marker at its edge cell.
- On the marker's row or column, color cells swept by shifted moving pixels maroon unless the final compacted line occupies them.

Key insight
The marker selects both the compression direction and the checkerboard color class that moves; maroon records the movement trail only along that marked line.

Detect thin '+' shapes in a single foreground color and recolor them to teal.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One foreground color (e.g. yellow) forms various shapes on the bg, some of which are small '+' crosses.

Rule:
- A '+' center is any foreground pixel whose 4 orthogonal neighbors are also foreground.
- Recolor each such center and its 4 neighbors to teal (8).
- All other pixels remain unchanged.

Key insight: Only compact 5-cell crosses qualify — a pixel embedded in a larger filled region also satisfies the neighbor check, so the rule highlights every local '+' motif, not just isolated ones.

<description>
Reflect the solid rectangular source objects across the full separator line and color the gap with the separator color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background contains one full-width or full-height one-pixel
  separator line in a non-background color.
- One other foreground color forms solid rectangular objects, all strictly on the same side of that separator.
- Remaining non-background pixels are scattered distractors.

Rule:
- Keep the input grid shape and unchanged pixels outside each affected corridor.
- Mirror each source object across the separator line.
- For every source object, recolor the rectangular strip between the
  original object and its reflection to the separator color, then paint the
  reflected object in the source color.

Key insight:
- The full straight line is a mirror axis; the real objects are identified
  structurally as the only solid rectangles confined to one side, while
  scattered pixels are noise that may be overwritten inside the corridor.

Mark the shallowest and deepest columns of a solid terrain boundary with vertical colored guide lines.

Input structure:
- The first row is a solid empty separator.
- Below it, each column consists of upper fill cells followed by a contiguous suffix of terrain cells.
- The bottom row is all terrain, so every column has a well-defined first terrain row.

Rule:
- Find the column whose first terrain row is latest; it is unique and its upper fill run becomes maroon.
- Find the rightmost column whose first terrain row is earliest; its upper fill run becomes yellow.
- Preserve the empty separator, terrain cells, and all other upper fill cells.

Key insight:
- The task is a column-height summary of the terrain profile: color the deepest upper run and the highest terrain peak.

Stagger the two horizontal input regions onto a larger maroon separator canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a rectangular grid with an even number of rows.
- The top half and bottom half are the two regions to preserve.
- Maroon is absent from the input and is used only as the new separator color.

Rule:
- Create an output with one extra row and one extra column, filled with maroon.
- Copy the top half into the upper-left corner.
- Copy the bottom half one row below the top region and one column to the right.

Key insight:
The output is not a recoloring of either region; it inserts an L-shaped maroon
gap by diagonally offsetting the lower half from the upper half.

Pack the colored sprites along the bottom edge from smallest to largest.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and several monochrome 4-connected
foreground sprites; a full-grid one-cell frame may surround the scene.

Rule
Remove any full-grid rectangular frame, sort the remaining sprites by pixel
area from smallest to largest, and paste their bounding-box sprites left to
right with each sprite bottom-aligned.

Key insight
The original locations do not determine the final slots; each sprite's area
gives the packing order, while its shape and color are preserved.

Assemble scattered jigsaw sprites around a central yellow anchor by pairing red connector pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = black (0). Several colored sprites scattered on the grid.
- One anchor sprite contains a 3×3 yellow (4) block.
- Each sprite has red (2) connector pixels along its edges.

Rule:
- The anchor stays in place; remaining sprites attach one at a time.
- Each sprite is translated so that one of its red pixels overlaps an unpaired red pixel on the growing assembly.
- Every red connector must pair with exactly one other, forming a complete joined structure.

Key insight: Red pixels act as jigsaw pegs — each must match exactly one counterpart, and the assembly order is determined by which unpaired connectors remain.

Connect two sprites using matching connector pixels, then tight-crop.

Input structure:
- Background color `bg`, sprite color `obj`, connector color `ctrl` (small, 2 components).
- Two main foreground sprites, plus possibly tiny detached pixels belonging to one sprite.

Rule:
- Identify the **base** sprite (closest to grid top-left).
- Translate the other sprite so its connector sits one cell above the base's connector.
- Stamp the plug onto the base; remove connectors (recolor `ctrl` to `obj`).
- Output is the tight crop around all non-background pixels.

Key insight: The connector pixels define the unique docking point and direction.

Extend each top-row control pixel downward as a vertical toggle ray in its own color.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Non-background pixels on the top row are control pixels, each identifying
  one column and one ray color.
- Foreground regions below may intersect these control columns.

Rule:
- For every top-row control pixel, process the cells below it in the same
  column down to the bottom edge.
- A cell that already has the control color is erased to the background.
- Every other cell on that downward ray is painted with the control color.
- The top-row control pixels themselves remain unchanged.

Key insight:
The top row is a set of vertical ray launchers; each ray toggles only cells
matching its own color and overwrites all other colors along that column.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

Mark each arrow-like sprite's pointed frame endpoint with its color and the opposite endpoint black.

Input structure:
- The grid has a one-pixel solid rectangular frame around a dominant interior background.
- Inside the frame are monochrome six-pixel sprites shaped as asymmetric T arrows.
- Each sprite has a length-4 bar and a length-3 crossbar one cell closer to the pointed end.

Rule:
- For each sprite, follow its bar axis from the shorter end to the frame.
- Paint that frame endpoint with the sprite color.
- Paint the opposite endpoint on the same row or column black.
- Leave the interior background, sprites, and all other frame pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
- The direction is encoded by the crossbar's off-center position: the nearer end is the pointing end.

Extend each colored marker from its directional sprite to a grid edge, painting a dotted ray and the whole edge side.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One repeated body color forms small 8-connected directional sprites.
- Each marker is a singleton non-background, non-body color embedded in one sprite.

Rule:
- The body pixels around a marker lie mostly behind it; the opposite direction is the marker's ray direction.
- Paint every second pixel from the marker along that ray, then paint the entire boundary side reached by the ray.
- If two painted boundary sides meet at a corner, make that shared corner black.

Key insight:
- The same seven-pixel body sprite rotates to encode the direction; its local center-of-mass bias points away from the ray.

Move each gray marker along its green path until it reaches the cell next to a black-green-black gate, erasing the path behind it.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Foreground components are made from a path color, a paired gate-end color, and single marker pixels.
- A gate is a straight end-center-end motif whose center has the path color and whose two ends share the gate-end color.

Rule:
- In every 4-connected foreground component with exactly one marker and one gate, erase the marker and all path-color pixels except the gate center.
- Place the marker on the unique path-color pixel adjacent to the gate center but not between the two gate ends.
- Components without both a marker and a gate stay unchanged.

Key insight: The black-green-black motif marks the stopping gate; the gray marker consumes the connected green path until it rests on the path cell immediately beside that gate.

Slide the non-square sprite to the square anchor and replace the anchor with the sprite's mirror image.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- There is one 8-connected non-background sprite that is not a solid 2x2 square.
- There is one solid 2x2 square anchor in another non-background color.

Rule:
- Move the sprite straight toward the anchor along their unique cardinal separation until it touches the anchor's near edge.
- Reflect the moved sprite across that near edge and draw the reflected copy in the anchor color.
- Clear the original locations; the output keeps only the moved sprite and reflected anchor-color copy.

Key insight:
- The 2x2 square marks the mirror line: its side facing the sprite becomes the contact edge for a two-color reflected pair.

Count same-color patterns per frame and represent the tally as dots inside.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Hollow rectangular frames in various colors.
- Small monochrome pattern sprites scattered outside frames.

Rule:
- Remove all small patterns from the grid.
- For each frame of color C, count how many patterns share color C.
- Draw that many dots along the frame's center row, spaced by 2, starting from the right.

Key insight: Frames act as tally displays — scattered same-color patterns are "absorbed" and their count is shown as interior dots.

Compute a grey result bar by adding teal bar heights and subtracting red bar heights.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and several bottom-aligned one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Teal bars are positive operands; red bars are negative operands.
- The penultimate column is an empty result slot.

Rule
- Keep every input bar unchanged.
- Compute result height = total teal bar height - total red bar height.
- Paint that many bottom cells of the penultimate column grey.

Key insight
- The bars encode arithmetic by height, with color providing the sign.

Extend the edge-touching green start bar through the corridor, turning at each teal blocker until the path leaves the grid.

Input structure:
- The background is the most common color.
- Exactly two foreground colors are present: a 2-pixel 4-connected start bar and many blocker pixels.
- Exactly one pixel of the start bar lies on the grid border.

Rule:
- Start from the border pixel of the bar and move through the other bar pixel into the grid.
- Paint every traversed non-blocker pixel with the start color.
- When the next cell is a blocker, turn to the unique perpendicular non-blocker neighbor; when the next cell is outside the grid, stop.

Key insight: The blocker pixels define a one-cell-wide corridor, so every interior collision has exactly one valid 90-degree turn.

Add the two missing colored arms of a centered diamond-sprite motif, or clear a completed motif to a blank square.

Input structure
An 11x11 board has orange background and pink separator bars forming nine 3x3 cells. Occupied cells contain a four-pixel diamond sprite; the center cell and one neighboring cell are red, and a completed board may also contain one grey and one teal sprite.

Rule
With only the two red sprites present, preserve the board and add grey and teal diamond sprites 135 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise from the non-center red arm. If those expected grey and teal sprites are already present, output an all-background square whose side length is the total number of sprite pixels.

Key insight
The non-center red sprite is an eight-neighbor direction from the center; the other two colored arms are fixed rotations of that direction.

Pack the non-background rows from three separated panels into one panel, scanning panels right-to-left.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid contains three equal-size panels separated by two full-height divider columns.
- The background is the dominant color; divider pixels use a color that appears only in the divider columns.

Rule:
- Read panels from right to left, and within each panel read rows from top to bottom.
- Keep each row that contains any non-background pixel, discarding all-background rows.
- Place the kept rows at the bottom of a single panel-shaped output, padding above with background rows.

Key insight:
- The task is row packing: the divider columns mark independent panels, and only the occupied rows are moved.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
