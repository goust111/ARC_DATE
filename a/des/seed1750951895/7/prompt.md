Recolor the sparse foreground pixels in scan order along their longer spread, cycling red, teal, and grey.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Every foreground object is a single isolated 4-connected pixel.
- The foreground pixel set has a rectangular bbox whose row or column extent defines the scan direction.

Rule:
- Keep the background unchanged.
- If the foreground bbox is at least as tall as it is wide, order foreground pixels row-major; otherwise order them column-major.
- Recolor the ordered pixels by repeating red, teal, grey from the first pixel onward.

Key insight:
- The original foreground colors are only markers; the output color depends on each marker's ordinal position in the dominant scan direction.

Complete a four-corner framed rectangle from one decorated anchor rectangle and its diagonal mate.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Two same-color solid rectangular anchors of the same size sit on opposite
  diagonal corners, with the first anchor above-left of the second.
- The upper-left anchor has two one-cell-thick vertical control bars to its
  right and two one-cell-thick horizontal control bars below it.

Rule:
- Copy the anchor rectangle into the two missing corners of the implied
  larger rectangle.
- Repeat the right-side control bars horizontally between the left and right
  anchors, using their spacing as the period, and draw the outer top and
  bottom borders in the first right-control color.
- Repeat the below-side control bars vertically between the top and bottom
  anchors, using the same period, and draw the outer left and right borders
  in the first below-control color.

Key insight: The small control bars are the first two ticks of two periodic
frame patterns; the diagonal anchor supplies the opposite corner and the
missing two anchor copies.

Composite two pattern tiles into a fourth panel using flood-fill from an indicator pixel.

Input structure:
- Four 5×5 panels in one row, border-separated.
- Panel 0: cue pixels = wall boundary (8-connected, edge-to-edge, through center)
           + one 8-isolated indicator pixel.
- Panels 1–2: source patterns. Panel 3: blank (to fill).

Rule:
- Flood-fill (4-conn) from indicator, blocked by wall → inside region.
- Inside → non-bg from panel 1; outside → non-bg from panel 2.
- Wall → panel 1 if non-bg; panel 2 fallback when wall is 4-connected.

Key insight: The cue panel's isolated indicator and wall partition the tile into inside/outside masks that select between the two source panels.

Move the side-attached foreground object to the opposite wall, shear its lower rows inward, and paint the crossed floor cells.

Input structure:
- The top row is the upper background color and the bottom row is the
  floor color.
- A single non-background, non-floor object touches exactly one vertical
  grid edge and rests immediately above the first solid floor row.

Rule:
- Clear the source object to the upper background color.
- Repaint each object row on the opposite side: the first three relative
  rows keep the edge alignment, and each lower row shifts one more pixel
  inward from that side.
- On the first floor row, repaint the traversed side-to-object segment
  maroon, stopping just before the final outer bottom support pixel.

Key insight:
- The side of the source object gives the horizontal direction, while the
  row index inside the object gives the one-cell-per-row diagonal shear.

Expand each colored control pixel into its corresponding fixed 4x4 glyph.

Input structure:
- Black background with single-pixel markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and/or 8.
- Some inputs also show a sample 4x4 glyph in the output color, with a same-rule marker just below-right of the sample.

Rule:
- Replace each marker color by its learned 4x4 glyph: 2->yellow frame, 3->blue ring, 5->pink diagonal blocks, 8->orange X.
- Paint each glyph with its top-left corner at the marker pixel, clipping at the grid boundary.
- Remove the sample glyphs and skip their below-right label markers.

Key insight:
- The colored pixels are control pixels for a fixed glyph alphabet; non-control sample glyphs are only legend entries, not preserved scene objects.

Move each vertical stream of pixels into a bottom-aligned centered pile.

Input structure
- A mostly background grid contains one or more vertical source columns of
  foreground pixels.
- Each source column has n^2 foreground pixels, and the top-to-bottom color
  sequence splits into monochrome groups of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Rule
- Clear the canvas to background.
- For each source column, read the foreground colors from top to bottom and
  rebuild them at the bottom below the same column as odd-width centered
  rows of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Key insight
- The scattered vertical pixels are falling grains; a square number of
  grains decomposes into the odd row widths of a centered pyramid.

Reorder 5×5 blocks into a connected strip by matching edge foreground pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = background; sep = divider color (full row/column lines).
- Several 5×5 sprite blocks in a grid, separated by sep lines.

Rule:
- Two blocks "connect" when their facing edges share foreground pixels at the same offset (e.g., A's right edge ∩ B's left edge).
- Chain all blocks in the orientation (horizontal or vertical) that admits a complete sequence.
- Output is a 1×N strip of blocks in chain order, separated by sep lines.

Key insight: Edge-contact overlap determines both block ordering and output orientation.

Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

Assemble scattered rectangular pieces into a rectangle at an L-marker corner.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg rectangular pieces scattered on the grid.
- 3-pixel L-marker (2x2 minus one cell) tags the corner; the gap is the corner cell.

Rule:
- rect_col = most common color across all piece pixels; all outer rectangle edges must be rect_col.
- Translate pieces (no rotation) to tile the rectangle; touching edges must match, with rect_col as wildcard.

Key insight: rect_col acts as wildcard during edge matching — only non-rect_col pixels at shared boundaries must agree.

Drop the columns of the top marker downward, stopping blue-ended columns on grey obstacles and letting maroon-ended columns pass to the bottom.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The most numerous non-background color forms stationary grey obstacle pixels.
- The other two colors form a single 3x3 top-edge marker whose top two rows
  are maroon and whose bottom row contains maroon or blue control pixels.

Rule
- Erase the top marker.
- Treat each marker column as a vertical drop retaining its three colors.
- A column whose bottom control pixel is blue stops immediately above the
  first grey pixel below that column, or bottom-aligns if none exists.
- Contiguous maroon-ended columns pass through obstacles and bottom-align;
  if such a run has a clear down-right slide from a grey ledge, shift the
  run one column right before bottom-aligning.
- When a maroon-ended drop lands through a grey bar on the bottom edge, clear
  the rest of the marker-width gap in that bottom bar.

Key insight
- The bottom row of the top marker is a control strip: blue cells mean
  "stick to the first obstacle," while maroon cells mean "fall through."

Stamp recolored sprites into a framed region using placeholder positions and a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg background, a rectangular single-color frame, colored placeholder cells inside the frame.
- Outside the frame: sprite shapes (one per placeholder color) and a small legend mapping each placeholder color to an output color.

Rule:
- Find the frame and its interior placeholders.
- For each placeholder color, locate the matching-color sprite outside the frame.
- Stamp each sprite at the placeholder's position inside the frame.
- Recolor every stamped sprite to the output color defined by the legend.

Key insight: The legend pairs (overlapping two-color glyphs outside the frame) dictate the final recoloring — placeholder color selects the shape, legend maps it to the output color.

Move the source-color pixels into the unique outline interior whose size matches the source count.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color forms 8-connected outline objects with row-wise interior cells.
- The other foreground color supplies a set of source pixels away from the chosen outline.
Rule
- For each possible outline color, compute each 8-connected outline object's
  row-span interior: background pixels strictly between the leftmost and
  rightmost outline pixels on each occupied row.
- Select the unique outline interior whose cell count equals the total
  number of pixels of the other foreground color.
- Erase the source pixels and paint that matched interior with the source color.
Key insight
- The colors are roles, not fixed IDs: the source color is identified by
  counting, and the destination is the outline with a matching interior area.

Slide black shapes rightward to a grey separator, then shoot red rays from enclosed holes.

Input structure:
- A vertical grey (5) separator column divides the grid into left and right halves.
- Black shapes sit on the left side against a background color (bg).

Rule:
- Translate each black connected component rightward until its right edge is flush with the separator.
- After sliding, find enclosed bg regions (holes) within the black shapes that touch the column just left of the separator.
- For each row spanned by such a hole, emit a red ray across the entire right half of the grid.

Key insight: Only holes adjacent to the separator trigger rays — the sliding creates enclosures that act as "nozzles" projecting rightward.

Slide each inner colored object horizontally into the same-colored vertical wall until it touches an obstacle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are two non-background colors.
- One foreground color fills the left column and the other fills the right column.
- Extra 8-connected objects of each wall color appear away from that color's wall.

Rule
- Clear the extra objects from their original positions.
- For each wall color, process its 8-connected extra objects from nearest to farthest from the matching wall.
- Slide each object horizontally toward its matching wall as far as possible without overlapping the wall or an already settled object of the same color.
- Keep the two vertical wall columns fixed.

Key insight
- The side columns act like color-specific gravity walls: same-colored objects compact sideways against their own wall while preserving each object's shape.

Reorient each two-pixel blue/pink segment so it reads pink then blue when viewed from its border marker.

Input structure
- The background is dominant, with one border-only marker color and blue/pink foreground segments.
- Every marker lies on the outer border and points inward along its row or column.
- Along exactly one inward ray from each marker is a single adjacent two-pixel blue/pink segment.

Rule
- For each marker, look inward perpendicular to the border side containing the marker.
- Rewrite the two blue/pink pixels on that ray so the nearer one is pink and the farther one is blue.
- Keep marker pixels, background pixels, and all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The marker gives a local viewing direction; the segment's required order is relative to that marker, not to global row or column order.

Move every object above the solid bottom stripe upward by its own pixel count.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, exactly one full-width non-background row
that acts as a fixed stripe, and one or more 4-connected monochrome objects
above that stripe.

Rule
Clear each object from its original cells, then translate it straight upward
by the number of pixels in that object, preserving its shape and color. Leave
the full-width stripe unchanged.

Key insight
Each object's area is also its vertical displacement; the full-width row is a
fixed baseline, not a moving object.

Convert each colored partitioned frame into a horizontal bar whose length is its number of enclosed regions.

Input structure:
- Black background with several axis-aligned colored line drawings.
- The line drawings are damaged by scattered pixels of one non-background noise color and by overlaps with other drawings.
- Each real drawing is a rectangular partitioned frame enclosing one or more background regions.

Rule:
- For each non-background color, reconstruct its horizontal and vertical wall segments from dense row/column evidence.
- Count the 4-connected background regions fully enclosed by those reconstructed walls.
- The color with no enclosed region is the noise/pad color.
- Sort drawing colors by enclosed-region count; equal counts are ordered by which reconstructed frame covers the other.

Key insight:
- The scattered color is not an object; it only pads the histogram, while each true object's room count is stable after rectilinear wall reconstruction.

Compress each colored ray pixel inward until it touches that color's 3x3 anchor block.
Input structure
- A uniform background grid with non-background colors.
- Each foreground color contains one solid 3x3 anchor block; all other pixels of that color lie on straight 8-neighbor rays aimed at that block.
Rule
- Keep anchor blocks fixed, erase loose foreground pixels, and for each ray pack its pixels into consecutive cells adjacent to the anchor along the same ray.
Key insight
- The scattered pixels are displaced pixels on visible row, column, or diagonal sightlines back to their same-colored 3x3 block.

Recolor every pixel whose color is not one of the two most frequent input colors to orange.

Input structure:
- The grid contains at least three colors.
- Orange is absent from the input and is used only as the output replacement color.
- Exactly two colors occupy the top two frequency ranks; they may tie with each
  other, but no third color ties them at the cutoff.

Rule:
- Preserve every pixel whose color is one of the two most frequent input colors.
- Replace every other pixel with orange.

Key insight:
- The visible distinction is not the numeric identity of the colors but their
  population: the two majority colors remain, while all minority colors merge
  into the new orange color.

Keep only the center color and redraw it as a diagonal ray to its indicated corner.

Input structure:
- The grid is an odd square with a unique dominant background color.
- The center pixel is foreground.
- Every off-center pixel with the center color lies in the same diagonal
  quadrant relative to the center.

Rule:
- Fill the whole output with the background color.
- Use the quadrant of the center-colored pixels to choose one diagonal
  direction from the center.
- Draw a continuous line of the center color from the center to the grid
  edge in that direction.

Key insight:
The color at the exact center identifies the surviving color, while the
other pixels of that color identify which corner the center should connect to.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成 5 个 `<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **不建议使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算 / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id是不可用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 5 个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。
