<description>
Move the source-color pixels into the unique outline interior whose size matches the source count.

Input structure
- The grid has a dominant background and exactly two foreground colors.
- One foreground color forms 8-connected outline objects with row-wise interior cells.
- The other foreground color supplies a set of source pixels away from the chosen outline.
Rule
- For each possible outline color, compute each 8-connected outline object's
  row-span interior: background pixels strictly between the leftmost and
  rightmost outline pixels on each occupied row.
- Select the unique outline interior whose cell count equals the total
  number of pixels of the other foreground color.
- Erase the source pixels and paint that matched interior with the source color.
Key insight
- The colors are roles, not fixed IDs: the source color is identified by
  counting, and the destination is the outline with a matching interior area.

Expand each input pixel into a miniature same-color mask of the whole grid.

Input structure
- The input is a non-empty two-dimensional grid of foreground colors.
- Black is reserved for the empty/background pixels introduced in the expanded output.
- The output has one input-shaped block for each input pixel.

Rule
- For every input pixel with color c, replace that pixel by a block the same shape as the input.
- Inside the block, write c exactly where the original input also has color c.
- Write black everywhere else in the block.

Key insight
Each pixel selects the global mask of its own color; the result is the blockwise self-mask of the grid.

Fill the region enclosed by a wall sprite and radiate color outward through its opening.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Wall = most frequent non-bg color, forming a partial enclosure (e.g. U-shape).
- A fill-color pixel sits inside the enclosed area. Other non-bg pixels may act as obstacles.
Rule:
- Flood-fill the enclosed area with the fill color, radiating outward through the wall's open end.
- Obstacles cast "shadows" along the radiate direction, blocking fill behind them.

Key insight: The wall endpoints define the opening direction; fill radiates outward through it, and obstacles block propagation along that same axis.

Rotate each magenta source pixel 90 degrees counterclockwise around its matched blue pivot, recoloring the new pixel orange.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The only foreground colors are blue pivot pixels and magenta source pixels.
- Each magenta source can be paired one-to-one with a blue pivot in the same
  row or column.

Rule:
- Remove all magenta source pixels.
- For each matched source/pivot pair, preserve the source distance from the
  pivot but rotate its offset 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Paint the rotated in-bounds target orange; if the target is outside the
  grid, the source simply disappears.

Key insight:
The blue pixels are rotation centers, and row/column alignment gives a
unique global matching from each magenta source to its pivot.

Normalize vertical two-color bars between paired marker columns around the marker rows.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- A row of red marker pixels sits directly above a row of gray marker pixels
  in the same alternating columns.
- The columns between adjacent markers contain vertical bars made from a
  contiguous teal run above a contiguous blue run.

Rule
- Keep the marker pixels and all non-bar background cells fixed.
- Let h be the maximum teal-run height among the bar columns; paint teal in
  every bar column for h rows ending at the red marker row.
- In each bar column, move its blue run to start at the gray marker row and
  fill all lower cells in that column with maroon.

Key insight
- The marker rows are a baseline: teal is normalized into a common upper
  band, while each blue run keeps its own height below the baseline.

<description>
Stamp translated copies of a monochrome template guided by a singleton pixel layout.

Input structure:
- bg = background. A large monochrome shape (template, color T).
- Singleton pixels elsewhere: exactly one is color T (layout origin); the rest share color O (overlap color).
- Singletons sit on a uniform-spacing lattice.

Rule:
- Convert each singleton's offset from the origin into coarse lattice units.
- Place a template copy at each offset, scaled by template height/width.
- The origin's copy is painted O instead of T.
- Any pixel covered by two or more copies is also recolored to O.

Key insight: The single T-colored singleton identifies both the origin position and the "self" copy, which is uniquely recolored.

<description>
Move each source pixel toward the separator when it matches its aligned reference pixel, otherwise to the far edge.

Input structure:
- A single full separator line is part of a rectangular frame; the frame's
  extra cells mark the reference side.
- On the reference side, one row or column of colored pixels is aligned
  with one row or column of source pixels on the opposite side.
- Each side has its own dominant background color.

Rule:
- Compare each source pixel with the reference pixel on the same row or column.
- If their colors match, place the source pixel in the cell adjacent to the
  separator on the source side.
- If their colors differ, place the source pixel on the far outer edge along
  the same row or column.
- Erase the original source pixels to the source-side background; keep the
  frame and reference pixels unchanged.

Key insight:
The extra frame cells identify which side is the reference; equality with the
aligned reference pixel decides whether each source pixel moves inward or outward.

Recover the repeating background pattern hidden under the largest solid rectangle.

Input structure:
- The grid is covered by a small row/column periodic pattern.
- Several non-pattern colors form solid rectangular foreground objects that
  overwrite the pattern.
- The requested output region is the largest of those solid rectangles.

Rule:
- Find every 4-connected monochromatic object whose bounding box is a filled
  rectangle with both dimensions greater than one.
- Treat those rectangles as masks, infer the smallest repeating tile that is
  consistent with all remaining visible pixels, and repaint the largest
  rectangle's coordinates with that tile.

Key insight: The rectangle colors are occluders; the visible pixels outside
them are enough to reconstruct the original periodic background underneath.

Fill each black 5x5 region's missing interior positions with a fixed 3x3 positional color legend.

Input structure
- The grid uses teal as the dominant background and black for one or more
  5x5 regions.
- Each black region has a black one-pixel border and a 3x3 interior that
  may already contain teal pixels.

Rule
- Overlay the legend 1 7 6 / 4 8 5 / 2 9 3 on the 3x3 interior of every
  5x5 black region.
- Wherever an interior non-center legend position is still black, recolor it
  to the corresponding legend color; leave existing teal pixels, the center,
  and the black border unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored output pixels are not derived from the teal motif shape; they
  are the fixed position labels for the missing cells of each 3x3 interior.

Repeat each 3x3 control-center sprite toward the matching solid rectangle until a copy first overlaps that rectangle.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- Each sprite is a 3x3 foreground object whose eight border pixels have one color and whose center has a different control color.
- For every control color, there is exactly one separate solid rectangular object of that color.

Rule
- Match each sprite to the unique solid rectangle whose color equals the sprite center.
- Copy the whole 3x3 sprite in the cardinal direction of that rectangle, stepping by three cells each time.
- Stop after pasting the first copy whose 3x3 bbox overlaps the rectangle; copied pixels overwrite the rectangle there.

Key insight
The center pixel is not the paint color: it is a destination key, while the entire 3x3 sprite is the motif tiled along the straight path.

Reorder 5×5 blocks into a connected strip by matching edge foreground pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = background; sep = divider color (full row/column lines).
- Several 5×5 sprite blocks in a grid, separated by sep lines.

Rule:
- Two blocks "connect" when their facing edges share foreground pixels at the same offset (e.g., A's right edge ∩ B's left edge).
- Chain all blocks in the orientation (horizontal or vertical) that admits a complete sequence.
- Output is a 1×N strip of blocks in chain order, separated by sep lines.

Key insight: Edge-contact overlap determines both block ordering and output orientation.

Mark the missing center of each plus-shaped arrangement of four two-pixel bars with yellow.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- The single foreground color forms isolated 4-connected objects, each a horizontal or vertical two-pixel bar.
- Some bars form an implied plus sign: two horizontal bars and two vertical bars around an empty center, with a one-pixel gap between the center and each bar.

Rule:
- Keep the input unchanged except at implied plus-sign centers.
- For every background pixel with foreground bars at offsets 2-3 cells left, right, above, and below, recolor that center yellow.
- The one-pixel gaps immediately next to the center in the four cardinal directions must remain background.

Key insight:
- The yellow pixels are not extending a line; they identify the shared missing center where four separated two-pixel bars align as a plus sign.

Recolor wall-separated background regions alternately, starting with grey in the lower-left region.

Input structure
- The grid has one dominant background color and one foreground wall color.
- The wall pixels form one or more 4-connected one-cell-thick segments.
- Each wall segment separates exactly two 4-connected background regions.
Rule
- Keep all wall pixels unchanged.
- Label the 4-connected background regions and connect two labels when they
  touch opposite sides of the same wall segment.
- Color the region containing the lower-left corner grey, then flip between
  grey and green across every wall adjacency.
Key insight
- The red walls define a bipartite map of regions; the lower-left background
  region fixes which side of the alternating coloring is grey.

Turn a 4-cell-wide strip of 2x2 blocks into four nested corner-fill patterns.

Input structure
The input is an even-sized rectangle whose shorter dimension is four pixels.
It can be partitioned exactly into 2x2 blocks, giving one block for each layer
of the output quadrants.

Rule
Read the 2x2 blocks in reverse row-major order: bottom-right block first,
moving left, then moving upward. For each block, send its top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels to the layer sequences of the
upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right output quadrants.

Key insight
Each input 2x2 block supplies the four colors for one concentric layer, and
the layer order is the block order from bottom-right back to top-left.

Rewrite a corner L block into two nested L borders and a diagonal trace.

Input structure
A rectangular grid has exactly two colors: one color forms a one-cell-thick
L on two adjacent outer edges, and the other color fills the remaining
rectangle.

Rule
Normalize the L to the top-left corner. Paint the outer top-left L with the
fill color, the next inner L with the original border color, and the main
diagonal of the remaining inner rectangle with the fill color. All other
cells become color 8, then the original orientation is restored.

Key insight
The corner of the input L determines the orientation; after flipping to a
canonical top-left L, the output is the same nested-layer pattern for every
example.

Project maroon markers into adjacent grey or pink 3x3 squares, erasing grey squares afterward.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background, solid 3x3 grey and/or pink squares, and maroon marker pixels or segments directly touching one side of exactly one square.
Rule
Grey squares are erased; their adjacent maroon markers stay in place and stamp the nearest edge cell inside the grey square. Pink squares stay pink; their adjacent maroon markers disappear and stamp the corresponding cell on the square's middle row or middle column.
Key insight
The side touched by a marker determines the projection: grey uses the near edge, while pink uses the centerline, preserving the marker's coordinate along that side.

<description>
Combine each column's repeated template mask with its single solid color swatch.

Input structure:
- The grid is a table of framed panels separated by background rows/columns.
- The leftmost column gives one solid row-label color for each panel row.
- In each panel column, exactly one panel has a solid non-background interior,
  while the other panels share the same mask drawn in one template color on
  the background.

Rule:
- For every panel column, find the row containing the solid interior swatch.
- Rebuild one output panel using that row's left label as the frame color.
- Fill the repeated template mask with the swatch color and leave the mask
  background cells as background; separate rebuilt panels with one
  background column.

Key insight:
The table encodes a colorized stencil per column: the solid panel supplies
the paint color and frame label, while the duplicate template panels supply
the shape mask.

Swap each 5x5 sprite with its corner marker color and stamp same-marker composite masks into the matching corner.

Input structure:
- A 30x30 grid has one dominant background color.
- Non-background corner pixels are marker labels.
- Every other foreground color is the body of one 5x5 sprite containing exactly one pixel of a corner marker color.

Rule:
- For each sprite, recolor body pixels to the sprite marker color and recolor the marker pixel back to its body color.
- If a marker lies on the side facing its matching corner and another same-marker sprite has a body pixel at that same local cell, use that visible body color for the marker pixel.
- For each corner marker, overlay the masks of all sprites with that marker color into the corner 5x5 block and paint the visible composite with the marker color.

Key insight:
The corner pixels are labels that group 5x5 sprites by their embedded marker color; each labeled corner shows the grouped sprite silhouette.

Move the single marker to the endpoint reached by sliding along the obstacle contour.

Input structure:
- A dominant background color fills the canvas.
- One single-pixel marker sits away from a connected obstacle region of the
  remaining color.
- The marker has exactly one horizontal or vertical sightline to the obstacle.

Rule:
- Find the last background pixel before the obstacle along that sightline.
- From that pixel, try the two diagonal turns that continue around the
  obstacle boundary.
- Move the marker to the endpoint of the turn that remains 4-adjacent to the
  obstacle for the longest distance.

Key insight:
The marker is not placed by distance to the obstacle; it first points to the
obstacle, then follows the visible outside contour until that contour segment ends.

Extend each top-row control pixel downward as a vertical toggle ray in its own color.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- Non-background pixels on the top row are control pixels, each identifying
  one column and one ray color.
- Foreground regions below may intersect these control columns.

Rule:
- For every top-row control pixel, process the cells below it in the same
  column down to the bottom edge.
- A cell that already has the control color is erased to the background.
- Every other cell on that downward ray is painted with the control color.
- The top-row control pixels themselves remain unchanged.

Key insight:
The top row is a set of vertical ray launchers; each ray toggles only cells
matching its own color and overwrites all other colors along that column.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
