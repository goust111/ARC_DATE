Replace the scattered foreground markers with a bottom-left count rectangle whose two corner diagonals encode the marker counts.

Input structure
- A background grid with exactly two foreground colors used as scattered marker pixels.
- The two foreground colors have distinct pixel counts.

Rule
- Ignore marker positions and use only the two foreground counts.
- Make a 16-by-16 background canvas, fill a bottom-left red rectangle whose height is the smaller count and width is the larger count.
- Paint yellow pixels along the two rising 45-degree diagonals from the rectangle's bottom-left and bottom-right corners.

Key insight
- The marker colors and positions vary between examples; their counts alone determine the output rectangle dimensions.

Extract the top-left or top-right 2x2 corner crop selected by the top edge clue.

Input structure
- The input is a square color grid whose answer is one of the two 2x2 crops
  touching the top edge and a grid corner.
- A repeated color on the top row, when present, acts as the primary side cue.
- Otherwise, the two top corner colors have different whole-grid frequencies.

Rule
- If a top-row color repeats, find the repeated top-row occurrence nearest to
  a left or right edge and take the 2x2 top-corner crop on that side.
- If the top row has no repeated color, compare the whole-grid frequencies of
  the two top-corner colors and take the side whose corner color is rarer.

Key insight
- The task is not asking for an arbitrary 2x2 search: the decisive information
  is on the top edge, and it selects which top corner crop to keep.

Repair markers embedded in the main object and copy the remaining markers one pixel toward the solid edge.

Input structure:
- A mostly background grid contains one solid non-background edge line.
- Apart from that edge and the background, there is one large main object
  color and a smaller marker color.
- Each marker is either embedded in the main object, touching it on at
  least three 4-neighbor sides, or isolated on the background.

Rule:
- Embedded markers are recolored to the main object color.
- Isolated background markers remain in place and also paint the adjacent
  background pixel in the direction of the solid edge line.
- All other pixels are unchanged.

Key insight:
The full edge line is a direction cue: it tells which way the background
markers extend, while markers surrounded by the main object are simply
defects to be filled.

Complete outlined shapes and carry attached shadow pixels along their edges.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Each active color marks vertices of an 8-direction aligned outline.
- A start vertex can have adjacent non-bg, different-colored shadow pixels.
- Other colored pixels may be distractors unless they lie on valid drawable edges.

Rule:
- For each color, order its pixels by polar angle around their centroid to form a cycle.
- Draw only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree edges whose interiors are clear.
- From the chosen start vertex, copy adjacent shadow offsets along each drawable edge
  when the parallel path is in bounds and clear.

Key insight: The main outline is reconstructed first, then the start vertex's neighbor offsets define parallel shadow strokes.

Grow four clockwise spiral wall paths from the tips of a teal cross.

Input structure:
- bg = 0 (black). A single teal (8) cross centered in the grid.

Rule:
- Each arm tip launches a "turtle" heading 90° right of its outward direction.
- Movement priority: turn right > go straight > turn left (left only if not on border).
- Normal step = 2 cells; step right after a turn = 1 cell.
- Each new cell must have a 1-cell orthogonal gap from all existing walls except the predecessor.

Key insight: The right-turn preference plus alternating 2/1 step lengths creates self-avoiding spirals that tile the grid with uniform spacing.

Push the central solid rectangle to the grid edge, splitting the perpendicular target rectangle around its path.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- There are exactly three monochrome foreground objects arranged on one
  horizontal or vertical axis.
- The middle object on that axis is a solid rectangular moving object.
- One end object is a solid rectangle or bar whose long side is perpendicular
  to the movement axis; this is the target to split.

Rule
- Move the middle rectangle along the axis toward the target until it is
  flush with the grid edge in that direction.
- Clear the original middle rectangle and the original target.
- Split the target through the moving rectangle's two-cell-wide path and
  shift the two halves one cell outward perpendicular to the movement.
- Keep the other end object unchanged.

Key insight
- The non-target end object acts as a pusher; the central rectangle travels
  away from it through the perpendicular target, opening a matching gap.

Move the diagonal foreground segment to the next longer run along the same up-right diagonal.

Input structure
The grid has one background color and one foreground color. The foreground pixels form a
contiguous one-pixel-wide segment on a single anti-diagonal.

Rule
Erase the current segment. If its columns are c0..c1 and its length is L, draw the same
color on columns c1+1..c1+L+1 along the same anti-diagonal.

Key insight
The segment advances past its current upper-right end by one whole segment position, and
the next segment is one pixel longer than the current one.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

Keep only the lower-panel colors named by the top markers and expand each marker into an object-count bar.

Input structure
A black instruction strip sits above a non-black rectangular scene panel.  The strip contains one-cell markers
in the first column, and each marker color is a candidate object color in the lower panel.  The lower panel has
a unique dominant background color and scattered 4-connected foreground objects.

Rule
In the lower panel, preserve objects whose colors appear as top markers and recolor every other foreground
object to the panel background.  In the instruction strip, replace each marker by a horizontal run from column 0
whose length is the number of 4-connected lower-panel objects of that marker color; erase markers with count 0.

Key insight
The top strip is a color filter plus a compact count summary: marker colors select which lower-panel objects
survive, and their bars report the number of surviving objects by color.

Fill each vertical foreground band's background cells with the color of the next band to its right.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each other color occupies a separate vertical band defined by that color's
  minimum and maximum columns.
- Within a band, all cells are either that band's color or background.

Rule
- Order the bands from left to right.
- In each band, replace background pixels with the color of the next band in
  that order, wrapping from the rightmost band back to the leftmost.
- Preserve all existing foreground pixels and all background pixels outside
  the bands.

Key insight
- The column bands form a cyclic palette legend: a band's gaps are completed
  by borrowing the color from its right-hand neighbor, not by changing the
  band's existing pixels.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

Mark the shallowest and deepest columns of a solid terrain boundary with vertical colored guide lines.

Input structure:
- The first row is a solid empty separator.
- Below it, each column consists of upper fill cells followed by a contiguous suffix of terrain cells.
- The bottom row is all terrain, so every column has a well-defined first terrain row.

Rule:
- Find the column whose first terrain row is latest; it is unique and its upper fill run becomes maroon.
- Find the rightmost column whose first terrain row is earliest; its upper fill run becomes yellow.
- Preserve the empty separator, terrain cells, and all other upper fill cells.

Key insight:
- The task is a column-height summary of the terrain profile: color the deepest upper run and the highest terrain peak.

Extend diagonal rays outward from outer-border segments adjacent to diamond shapes on a checkerboard.

Input structure:
- Checkerboard bg (two most common colors).
- Hollow diamond outlines (8-pixel) in a non-bg color (inner border).
- Short diagonal line segments in another non-bg color adjacent to each diamond edge (outer border).

Rule:
- For each outer-border segment, determine the outward direction (perpendicular to the segment, away from the diamond).
- From each endpoint of the segment, cast a diagonal ray outward, painting over bg pixels with the segment's color until hitting a non-bg pixel or the grid edge.

Key insight: Rays emit only from the two endpoints of each outer-border segment, not every pixel, and travel diagonally away from the diamond.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Straighten the single foreground mask into a centered horizontal segment of the same color and length.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- All non-background pixels share one foreground color.
- The number of foreground pixels fits in one centered row of the grid.

Rule:
- Erase the original foreground mask.
- Count its pixels, keep its color, and paint that many pixels as a horizontal segment.
- Place the segment on the middle row with equal background margin on the left and right.

Key insight:
- The original foreground shape is irrelevant except for its color and area; the output is the area normalized into the grid's central horizontal line.

<description>
Expand each sparse color object into a filled rectangular region using its legend-paired fill color.

Input structure
A background-color grid has a two-column legend in columns 0 and 1, starting at row 0: each row gives
a source color in the left column and that source color's fill color in the right column.  Outside the
legend, the foreground pixels are sparse dot objects whose colors are exactly the legend source colors.

Rule
Clear the legend.  For each source color, take the bbox of all of its non-legend dots, expand that bbox
by one pixel in every direction, and fill background cells inside the expanded rectangle with the paired
legend fill color while preserving every original non-legend dot.

Key insight
The legend order is also the layer order: earlier legend rows are in front, so fill rectangles are painted
from the last legend row back to the first and higher-priority fills overwrite lower-priority fills.

Carve color-matched motifs into solid blocks and pack them into a compact grid.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Several solid 5×5 monochrome blocks, each a distinct non-bg color.
- For each block color, a small same-colored motif sprite elsewhere on the grid.

Rule:
- Match each motif to its same-colored 5×5 block.
- Center the motif within the block and recolor those cells to bg (punching holes).
- Pack all carved blocks into an output grid preserving their original row/column order, separated by 1-cell gaps and a 1-cell outer border.

Key insight: The motif acts as a stencil — it's not stamped onto the block but carved out of it as background holes.

Repaint regions from T-shaped control markers, erase the markers, and optionally rotate based on a color-9 L-marker.

Input structure:
- The grid is a mosaic of monochrome regions.
- Color 1 forms T-shaped control markers on region boundaries.
- Some controls use three singleton color-1 pixels around a colored center; that center is a literal replacement color.
- An optional 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker triggers 90-degree rotation of the output.

Rule:
- For a color-1 T marker, the single stem points at the destination region to repaint.
- The two diagonal cells behind the stem identify the source region; the destination gets that source region's original color.
- For a colored-center T marker, the same stem identifies the destination, but the center color is the replacement.
- All marker cells are filled with the final color of the source-side region.
- A 5-cell L-shaped color-9 marker controls rotation: ┐ (corner top-right) → CCW 90°, ┌ (corner top-left) → CW 90°.

Key insight:
- The stem chooses what changes, while the two diagonals behind the stem choose where the marker itself belongs.

Recolor a cropped template and repeat it according to a component-count stencil.

Input structure:
- Solid blue (1) separator rows or columns split the grid into four sections.
- Section 1 is a black-background shape template; section 2 is a component-count stencil.
- Sections 3 and 4 are solid color swatches for output foreground and background.

Rule:
- Crop section 1 to the bbox of its non-black pixels and recolor it with the two swatches.
- Count 4-connected non-black components in section 2.
- Repeat the recolored crop that many times, inserting one background-colored row/column between copies.

Key insight: The second section encodes only the repeat count; the output orientation
is inherited from whether the input separators are columns or rows.

Paint the top-connected middle channel between two orange path components teal.

Input structure
- The background is black.
- One foreground color forms exactly two 4-connected one-pixel-wide path components.
- Optional non-background control pixels may sit in the channel between the two paths.

Rule
- Dilate each path component by one cell in the 8-neighborhood and intersect the two dilations; this gives the one-cell-wide middle channel.
- A control pixel in that channel is a blocker only when its 4-neighbors touch fewer than both path components; otherwise it is part of the channel and is repainted.
- After removing blockers, paint the channel component connected to the top edge teal and keep all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The desired pixels are not found by region filling; they are the geometric overlap of the two paths' one-cell halos, with weakly attached control pixels splitting the channel.

你的任务：
第一步：分析上述参考题中涉及的基础操作，思考这些操作之间有哪些非显而易见的串联方式。重点思考：
 - 一个操作的输出如何以意想不到的形式成为另一个操作的输入条件。
 - 信息可以通过哪些不直觉的方式编码在网格中。
 - 寻找已有操作之间新的因果关系和信息传递路径。

第二步：基于上述思考，开启头脑风暴，运用发散性思维，用中文创造至少5个全新的 ARC 谜题描述，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限。严格使用下面的 XML风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 若涉及计算，只允许使用简单的计数、排序与数量比较；不允许使用复杂的数学公式或运算。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来，但不代表题目一定简单。设计时需从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则可以很难发现，难到反复对比所有样例仍需要深度思考才能归纳出来，但一旦发现后必须能用来解释所有样例且产出唯一确定的输出。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入/输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 “red”。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 五个新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7.  题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。关键信息难以准确定位，需要反复对比尝试不同的角度才能发现真正的规则。


生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述20道参考题相同或者是类似，不可只是替换了颜色、方向、对象类型、维度等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径（解题者从样例中归纳规则的认知过程）应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5个样例中发现规律。
