Complete outlined shapes and carry attached shadow pixels along their edges.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Each active color marks vertices of an 8-direction aligned outline.
- A start vertex can have adjacent non-bg, different-colored shadow pixels.
- Other colored pixels may be distractors unless they lie on valid drawable edges.

Rule:
- For each color, order its pixels by polar angle around their centroid to form a cycle.
- Draw only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree edges whose interiors are clear.
- From the chosen start vertex, copy adjacent shadow offsets along each drawable edge
  when the parallel path is in bounds and clear.

Key insight: The main outline is reconstructed first, then the start vertex's neighbor offsets define parallel shadow strokes.

Extract the hidden two-color image by compacting the rows and columns of its complete mask.

Input structure
The grid contains one pair of colors whose pixels occupy every cell in the
cross product of their active rows and active columns; all other colors form
the surrounding filler or separators.
Rule
Find that unique color pair, keep exactly the rows and columns touched by
the pair, and return the induced subgrid.
Key insight
The target image is not chosen by color id; it is the only two-color mask
whose occupied pixels form a full rectangular row/column product after
deleting unused rows and columns.

Move the colored object from the lower bracket lane to the upper bracket lane and drop it to the bottom edge.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- One frame color forms exactly two 4-connected bracket objects: a top-edge bracket open downward and a bottom-edge bracket open upward.
- One other 4-connected foreground object sits in the lower bracket's interior column span.

Rule
- Remove the movable object from its original cells.
- Keep its shape and color unchanged.
- Paste it with its bbox columns aligned to the top bracket's interior columns and with its bbox bottom aligned to the grid bottom.

Key insight
- The lower bracket identifies the object's source lane; the upper bracket provides the target lane, and the final vertical placement is bottom-aligned.

Fill each vertical foreground band's background cells with the color of the next band to its right.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- Each other color occupies a separate vertical band defined by that color's
  minimum and maximum columns.
- Within a band, all cells are either that band's color or background.

Rule
- Order the bands from left to right.
- In each band, replace background pixels with the color of the next band in
  that order, wrapping from the rightmost band back to the leftmost.
- Preserve all existing foreground pixels and all background pixels outside
  the bands.

Key insight
- The column bands form a cyclic palette legend: a band's gaps are completed
  by borrowing the color from its right-hand neighbor, not by changing the
  band's existing pixels.

Connect same-color diagonal pixel pairs, then emit perpendicular rays from differently-colored pixels on those diagonals.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Line color (e.g. blue) has pixel pairs aligned on shared diagonals. Trigger color (e.g. magenta) pixels sit along those diagonals.

Rule:
- Draw diagonal lines connecting each pair of same-color aligned pixels.
- Where the diagonal crosses a trigger pixel, emit perpendicular diagonal rays (in the trigger's color) extending to the grid boundary.

Key insight: Trigger pixels act as beam-splitters — the perpendicular rays rotate 90° from the connecting diagonal's orientation.

Grow four clockwise spiral wall paths from the tips of a teal cross.

Input structure:
- bg = 0 (black). A single teal (8) cross centered in the grid.

Rule:
- Each arm tip launches a "turtle" heading 90° right of its outward direction.
- Movement priority: turn right > go straight > turn left (left only if not on border).
- Normal step = 2 cells; step right after a turn = 1 cell.
- Each new cell must have a 1-cell orthogonal gap from all existing walls except the predecessor.

Key insight: The right-turn preference plus alternating 2/1 step lengths creates self-avoiding spirals that tile the grid with uniform spacing.

Remove the left control column and roll the remaining image downward by the red marker's row.

Input structure
- The input is a rectangular grid with a one-cell-wide control column on the left.
- That control column is all pink except for exactly one red marker pixel.
- The columns to the right are the image that remains in the output.

Rule
- Delete the left control column.
- Let r be the row index of the red marker in that column.
- Cyclically shift the remaining image downward by r rows.

Key insight
- The red marker's vertical position encodes the row-roll amount; the pink
  column is only a control strip and is removed after reading it.

Expand the top-left seed mask into a recursive colored pattern and tile it across the full grid.

Input structure
- The background is the dominant color.
- All foreground lies in a top-left rectangle whose last row and last column are a solid secondary color.
- Removing that secondary-color row and column leaves a seed region containing background plus one primary color.

Rule
- Use the primary-color pixels in the seed as a binary mask.
- Replace each primary seed cell with a copy of the seed mask in the primary color, and each background seed cell
  with a copy of the seed mask in the secondary color.
- Repeat and crop that expanded tile to the original grid shape.

Key insight
The solid L-shaped secondary-color border is a legend, not output content; it supplies the color used when the
seed's background cells are expanded.

Simulate water pixels falling under gravity into basins formed by colored obstacles.

Input structure:
- bg = 0. Water pixels = color 1 (blue).
- Other colors form static solid structures (walls, steps, containers).
- Water starts in unstable positions above or beside basins.

Rule:
- Each water pixel falls straight down through bg cells.
- When blocked below, it slides diagonally through the unique open side cell.
- When resting on a surface, it slides horizontally toward the nearest gap where it can fall again.
- Process repeats until no water pixel moves.

Key insight: Water seeks the deepest reachable basin via diagonal and horizontal sliding, not just vertical fall.

Fill rectangles between diagonal marker pairs using a color legend.

Input structure:
- bg grid with a vertical legend at the bottom-left: each row is a (marker_color, fill_color) pair.
- Scattered L-shaped corner markers of each marker color define opposite corners of axis-aligned rectangles.
- Some markers are solid 2×2 blocks instead of corner pairs.

Rule:
- Read legend bottom-to-top; for each entry find all pixels of that marker color.
- Determine which two bbox corners carry L-shaped anchors — the *other* diagonal defines the fill region.
- Fill the diamond (all shortest-path cells between those two corners) with the legend's fill color.
- Solid 2×2 marker blocks are simply recolored to the fill color.
- Later legend entries are protected from earlier fills.

Key insight: The L-shaped anchors sit on the marker diagonal; the fill goes on the opposite diagonal of the bounding box.

Repair a one-cell-thick colored line network by replacing singleton markers, filling short orthogonal gaps, and redirecting yellow-marked arms to the edge.

Input structure:
- A rectangular grid with a dominant background.
- Line colors form one-cell-thick horizontal/vertical stroke fragments.
- Marker colors are exactly those whose 4-connected components are all singleton pixels.
- Red singleton markers are missing line cells; yellow singleton markers are directional controls next to a line endpoint.

Rule:
- Assign every marker to the nearest visible line color in row/column line-of-sight, preferring an endpoint supported along that same axis.
- For each line color, fill the gap between consecutive facing endpoints in a row or column.
- A yellow control erases the old straight arm on the far side of its endpoint and paints the same color from that endpoint through the control pixel to the grid edge.
- At crossings, yellow-control rays win; otherwise an original-vs-filled crossing uses the more fragmented pre-repair line color, while pure filled crossings use the lower color id.

Key insight: The singleton markers identify which sparse stroke fragments belong together; after they are colored, the intended lines are the axis-aligned gaps between facing endpoints, with yellow controls flipping one arm to the marked side.

Replace a corner L with a same-color right-triangle outline in the corresponding corner of an enlarged canvas.

Input structure:
- The input is a square grid with one background color and one foreground color.
- The foreground is a one-pixel-thick L inside a square bbox.
- The L touches exactly one horizontal grid edge and one vertical grid edge, identifying a corner.

Rule:
- Fill a square output canvas of side 3n-2, where n is the input side length, with the background color.
- Double the L leg length to get the triangle side length.
- Draw the two perpendicular triangle legs on the same output corner edges and connect their free endpoints with the diagonal.

Key insight:
- The input L encodes the corner, color, and side length of the triangle outline; the missing side is the diagonal between the L's two free endpoints.

Fill periodic progressions that shoot from a unique grid edge.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.  Sparse non-bg dots of several colors.
- All repeating colors originate from the same grid edge (top, bottom,
  left, or right — the one with the most non-bg dots).
- Each repeating color has exactly 2 dots per shooting-direction line;
  their gap defines the step.
- Every non-bg dot lies on a shooting-direction line that contains a
  repeating color.

Rule:
- Determine the unique shooting edge; left/right → rows, top/bottom → columns.
- For each shooting-direction line, the repeating color has exactly 2 dots;
  step = gap between them, offset = first position mod step.
- A different-colored dot aligned to the same beat (pos % step == offset) is
  a companion: it absorbs the ray and becomes the fill color, limiting the
  fill range to the span between repeating and companion dots.
- An unaligned dot is a bystander and left untouched.
- Without a companion the repeating color fills the entire line.

Key insight: the shooting edge is identified by counting boundary dots;
the gap between the two marker dots is the period; a companion sharing the
modular class acts as a wall that stops the ray and dictates the paint color.

Fill enclosed regions along a line seeded by unique border pixels.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- Colored lines/drawings on the grid.
- Unique single-pixel colors on the grid border mark seed endpoints of each line.

Rule:
- Each border seed pixel connects (8-connected) to a line drawing.
- Find closed bg cavities whose boundary touches that line.
- Flood-fill each such cavity with the seed pixel's color.

Key insight: Only cavities reachable through the seed's own line get filled; the seed's unique color acts as a per-line fill label.

Move each right-side colored shape into the left slot whose template color is its exact complement.

Input structure:
- The grid has two equal-width slots separated by one background column.
- Non-background rows form horizontal bands separated by all-background rows.
- Each band has a shared template color in the left slot and one colored source shape in the right slot.

Rule:
- For each band, define its destination shape as the cells in the left slot not occupied by the template color.
- Normalize every right-side source shape to right-slot coordinates and match it to the unique equal destination shape.
- Clear the original right-side source pixels and paint the matched left-slot complement with the source color.

Key insight:
The right-side objects are not placed by row order; each one completes the unique left template whose missing cells have the same shape.

Move the patterned edge band to the opposite edge along every row or column whose band slice contains the trail color.

Input structure
- The dominant color is the background.
- The two foreground colors are a frequent trail color and a rarer marker color.
- All marker pixels lie nearest to one grid edge, and that edge contains trail-color runs that define the source-band thickness.

Rule
- Choose the source edge identified by the marker pixels.
- A row or column perpendicular to that edge moves if its source-band slice contains the trail color.
- Copy that slice unchanged to the opposite edge, erase the remaining trail cells to background, and keep marker-only lines fixed.

Key insight
- The marker color identifies the active edge, while the trail color identifies which parallel rows or columns carry an edge-band slice across the grid.

Emit four teal beams from a square, turning at colored obstacles per a legend.

Input structure:
- Top band: grey (5) legend with colored vertical bars in cells; bar position (left or right) encodes turn direction.
- Below: main grid with bg, a solid teal (8) square, and colored obstacle blocks.

Rule:
- Remove the legend from the output.
- From the teal square, shoot a beam in each cardinal direction (as a sliding copy of the square).
- Each beam paints teal over bg cells as it moves.
- On hitting an obstacle of color C, consult the legend: bar on left → turn counterclockwise, bar on right → turn clockwise. Continue in the new direction.
- Beams stop at grid edges.

Key insight: The legend's bar position (left vs right within its cell) is the encoding for turn direction at each obstacle color.

Propagate a repeating striped pattern from a yellow border segment toward the opposite edge, recoloring foreground objects on certain stripes.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Foreground blobs of another color scattered in the interior.
- A short yellow (4) segment sits on one border edge.

Rule:
- From the yellow segment, march toward the opposite edge in steps of 2 cells, cycling colors Y, Y, G (4, 4, 3). The 1-cell gap between stripes is forced to bg.
- Yellow stripes paint only within the segment's span.
- Green stripes additionally recolor all non-bg pixels across the entire row/column to green.

Key insight: Green stripes act as a "flood" that recolors existing objects on the full row/column, while yellow stripes are confined to the segment span.

Highlight black defects in blue foreground by surrounding them with orange.

Input structure:
- Blue (1) foreground on black (0) bg; small black holes or protrusions within blue regions; occasional thin blue spurs into black areas.

Rule:
- Thin blue pixels mostly surrounded by black are absorbed into the background.
- Small black components (≤3 cells) and leaf pixels of larger black components are "defects."
- Each defect gets an orange (7) 8-neighbor halo; the defect pixels themselves stay black.

Key insight: Only structural anomalies—tiny isolated patches and dangling endpoints—are marked, not bulk black regions.

Combine each column's repeated template mask with its single solid color swatch.

Input structure:
- The grid is a table of framed panels separated by background rows/columns.
- The leftmost column gives one solid row-label color for each panel row.
- In each panel column, exactly one panel has a solid non-background interior,
  while the other panels share the same mask drawn in one template color on
  the background.

Rule:
- For every panel column, find the row containing the solid interior swatch.
- Rebuild one output panel using that row's left label as the frame color.
- Fill the repeated template mask with the swatch color and leave the mask
  background cells as background; separate rebuilt panels with one
  background column.

Key insight:
The table encodes a colorized stencil per column: the solid panel supplies
the paint color and frame label, while the duplicate template panels supply
the shape mask.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
