Shift alternating two-color row bars so each row aligns to the topmost bar's color columns.

Input structure:
- The dominant background surrounds horizontal two-pixel bars.
- Every foreground row has exactly one adjacent bar using the same two colors.
- The topmost bar gives the reference left/right column for each color.

Rule:
- Keep bars whose left color is already in its reference column.
- For a reversed bar, shift the whole two-pixel bar horizontally until its
  left color lands in that color's reference column.
- Background cells vacated by shifted bars become background.

Key insight:
- The rows are not recolored; each two-color bar is translated so equal
  colors line up with the topmost reference bar.

Select the majority interior marker color, then redraw the framed board as that color's frame plus its bounding-box outline.

Input structure:
- The top row is a copied palette made from adjacent equal color pairs.
- Below it is a one-cell-thick rectangular frame around a black interior.
- Non-black, non-frame interior pixels are marker colors; one marker color has
  the unique highest count.

Rule:
- Keep the palette row unchanged.
- Pick the uniquely most frequent interior marker color.
- Clear the lower board to black, recolor its outer frame with the picked color,
  and draw the picked color's interior bounding-box border.

Key insight:
- The noisy marker cloud is not preserved as pixels; only the majority marker
  color and its spatial extent define the output.

Recolor each non-singleton red object by its symmetry axis and erase isolated red pixels.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color and red 4-connected foreground objects.
- Every non-singleton red object has exactly one reflection symmetry category:
  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- Single red pixels are noise.

Rule:
- Start from an all-background output of the same shape.
- Recolor horizontally symmetric red objects blue, vertically symmetric objects
  green, and diagonally symmetric objects pink.
- Leave isolated red pixels as background.

Key insight: The target color is not tied to object position or size; it is a
label for the object's reflection symmetry.

<description>
Reveal the rectangular patch hidden by the solid marker using the grid's reflection symmetries.

Input structure:
- A square colored pattern with one solid rectangular marker color occluding a patch.
- The visible pattern has horizontal and vertical reflection symmetry on a large lower/right strip.
- The top and left outer strips also expose transpose counterparts for cells not recoverable by those reflections.

Rule:
- Find the unique color whose full extent is a solid rectangle; this rectangle is the output region.
- Infer the reflected strip start as the smallest row/column offset whose lower/right strips are mirror-consistent, ignoring marker pixels.
- For each marker pixel, copy the unique non-marker value in its horizontal/vertical reflection orbit; if that orbit is entirely hidden in the outer strip, use the transposed top/left-strip counterpart.

Key insight:
The marker is not part of the pattern; it covers a missing rectangle whose cells are still determined by the visible mirror or transpose copies elsewhere in the grid.

Clean each color layer by enforcing vertical mirror symmetry.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Several non-bg colors, each forming a nearly-symmetric pattern about some vertical axis.
- Some pixels in each color are "noise" that breaks the symmetry.

Rule:
- For each non-bg color, find the vertical axis that best explains its pixel layout.
- Remove any pixel that lacks a same-color mirror counterpart across that axis.

Key insight: Each color has its own independent symmetry axis; the task is per-color denoising, not whole-grid symmetry.

Recolor the unique safe route between the two maroon endpoints from teal to maroon.

Input structure
- A black background contains a teal 4-connected track, exactly two maroon endpoint pixels, and one or more orange blocker pixels embedded near the track.

Rule
- Treat each orange blocker and its 8-neighborhood as forbidden.
- In the remaining teal/maroon track graph, there is exactly one simple
  4-connected path between the maroon endpoints.
- Recolor teal pixels on that path to maroon; leave endpoints, blockers, and all other cells unchanged.

Key insight
- The orange pixels block nearby teal cells diagonally as well as orthogonally, which removes shorter decoy routes and makes the intended endpoint-to-endpoint path unique.

<description>
Mark every complete square object with red pixels just outside its corners.

Input structure:
- A uniform background contains one or more monochrome 4-connected foreground objects.
- The relevant objects are square frames or filled squares: their bbox is square
  and all cells on the bbox border have the object's color.
- Non-square bars and incomplete fragments may also appear and are ignored.

Rule:
- Keep the input unchanged.
- For each complete square object, paint red on the two outside background
  pixels orthogonally adjacent to each of the square's four corners.

Key insight: The transformation is not based on size or color; it selects
objects whose bounding box is a complete square border and labels only their
exposed outer corner-adjacent cells.

Recolor the sparse foreground pixels in scan order along their longer spread, cycling red, teal, and grey.

Input structure:
- The dominant color is the background.
- Every foreground object is a single isolated 4-connected pixel.
- The foreground pixel set has a rectangular bbox whose row or column extent defines the scan direction.

Rule:
- Keep the background unchanged.
- If the foreground bbox is at least as tall as it is wide, order foreground pixels row-major; otherwise order them column-major.
- Recolor the ordered pixels by repeating red, teal, grey from the first pixel onward.

Key insight:
- The original foreground colors are only markers; the output color depends on each marker's ordinal position in the dominant scan direction.

Connect the innermost mirrored marker pair(s) by filling their horizontal span.

Input structure
- The grid has one background color and one foreground color.
- Each foreground row contains exactly two foreground pixels mirrored across the vertical center.

Rule
- Find the foreground row pair(s) with the smallest horizontal gap between the two markers.
- Fill every pixel between those two markers in each selected row with the foreground color.
- Leave all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- Wider marker pairs are context; the closest marker pair(s) show the unresolved horizontal segment.

Crop the foreground object whose missing cells match marker shapes, and fill those missing cells with the marker colors.

Input structure
A dominant background surrounds several monochromatic foreground objects. Exactly one object has background gaps inside its bounding box whose component shapes are matched by separate marker objects.
Rule
Find that object, crop its bounding box, and replace each background gap component with the color of the separate marker component or components having the same normalized shape.
Key insight
The marker objects do not mark absolute positions; their shapes identify which gaps in the selected object should be colored, while objects with unmatched gaps are distractors.

Move the yellow 3x3 frame by the displacement encoded by the gray path, then draw its diagonal yellow corner rays.

Input structure:
- The background is black.
- One 3x3 yellow frame has a non-yellow control-color center.
- A second control-color pixel is connected through gray path pixels to a lone yellow endpoint.

Rule:
- Use the vector from the second control-color pixel to the lone yellow endpoint as the frame's translation.
- Fill the whole output with the control color.
- Draw the translated yellow frame and extend yellow diagonal rays outward from its four corners to the grid edge.

Key insight: The gray path's turns are irrelevant; its two colored endpoints encode the net displacement to apply to the frame.

Erase each target-color object crossed by the ray pointed by the bar-and-control marker.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There is one three-pixel straight marker bar and one singleton control pixel adjacent to the bar center.
- The remaining non-background color forms multiple 4-connected target objects.

Rule:
- Cast a straight ray from the marker bar center in the direction away from the adjacent control pixel.
- Find every 4-connected target-color object that intersects that ray.
- Recolor all pixels of those hit target objects to the background; all other pixels stay unchanged.

Key insight:
- The whole object is erased when the center ray touches any of its pixels; the full marker bar width is not swept.

Complete the framed area by expanding the unique upper template that contains the existing seed pixels.

Input structure:
- A teal background contains small colored template masks above a larger rectangular frame.
- The frame encloses one fill color arranged as a partial block-scaled copy of one template.
- The frame interior dimensions are an integer square scale of the matching template bbox.

Rule:
- Crop to the rectangular frame.
- Identify the unique upper template whose block-scaled mask covers every existing fill pixel inside the frame.
- Reset the frame interior to background and paint the whole scaled mask with the fill color.

Key insight:
The lower colored pixels are seed cells that reveal which upper template should be completed inside the frame.

Move bordered containers toward same-colored destination markers, charging gray cells to orange.

Input structure:
- bg = 6 (magenta). Black-bordered (0) rectangles with gray (5) / orange (7) interiors.
- A head sprite (9) sits adjacent to one container edge; a matching destination sprite lies along the movement axis.

Rule:
- Each container translates toward its destination along the head-to-dest axis.
- Steps = min(head-to-dest distance, number of gray interior cells).
- Gray cells become orange from the head-facing side inward, one per step.

Key insight: Gray cell count caps movement — a container stops short if it runs out of gray cells to charge.

Use the pink control pixel to choose where the maroon pixel belongs inside the grey 3x3 region, and turn the control pixel maroon.

Input structure:
- The grid contains one 3x3 region made from eight grey pixels and one maroon pixel.
- There is exactly one pink control pixel outside that region.

Rule:
- Restore the old maroon cell in the 3x3 region to grey.
- Compare the pink pixel to the 3x3 region: above/same band/below selects top/middle/bottom, and left/same band/right selects left/middle/right.
- Paint the selected cell maroon and recolor the pink control pixel maroon.

Key insight:
- The pink pixel acts as a relative-position marker for a 3x3 target inside the grey region.

Fire projectiles from 3-pixel triangle sprites; mark collisions with maroon or blue.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color. Non-bg 3-pixel sprites shaped as axis-aligned L's or diagonal V's.

Rule:
- Each triangle has an apex and an emission direction determined by its shape: L-shapes fire diagonally away from the missing corner; V-shapes fire along the axis away from the open side.
- A projectile lands exactly 5 cells from the apex in the emission direction.
- If it hits an existing sprite, that entire sprite is recolored to maroon (9).
- If two projectiles land on the same empty cell, that cell becomes blue (1); a lone projectile on empty bg paints maroon (9).

Key insight: The triangle's orientation encodes both direction and target; dual-projectile collisions on open bg produce blue, not maroon.

Expand a 3x3 block motif into a 5x5 block motif around its missing center.

Input structure:
- Teal background surrounds one 9x9 foreground motif.
- The motif is a 3x3 array of 3x3 blocks; the middle block is empty teal.
- Colored pixels immediately around the empty middle block encode the border
  of the missing center block.

Rule:
- Keep the original 9x9 motif in place.
- Copy each of the eight surrounding 3x3 blocks to the opposite outer slot
  of the implied 5x5 block grid, without rotating it.
- Fill the center block from the eight pixels around the hole; its center is
  the motif's majority foreground color.

Key insight: The visible 9x9 motif is the middle of a larger periodic
block-level pattern, and the empty center is reconstructed from its immediate
inner boundary.

Delete connected components whose colors match a legend swatch.

Input structure:
- Background (bg) fills most of the grid.
- Top-left corner: a small square legend region bordered on its bottom and right edges by a single color; the interior holds a set of "target" colors.
- Elsewhere: multicolored objects (4-connected components) on the bg.

Rule:
- Read the target color set from inside the legend border.
- For each connected component, check whether it contains **all** target colors.
- Erase (fill with bg) every component that does; leave all others unchanged.
- Output grid is the same size.

Key insight: The legend acts as a filter specification — only components carrying the full color palette shown in the legend are removed.

Fill each black 5x5 region's missing interior positions with a fixed 3x3 positional color legend.

Input structure
- The grid uses teal as the dominant background and black for one or more
  5x5 regions.
- Each black region has a black one-pixel border and a 3x3 interior that
  may already contain teal pixels.

Rule
- Overlay the legend 1 7 6 / 4 8 5 / 2 9 3 on the 3x3 interior of every
  5x5 black region.
- Wherever an interior non-center legend position is still black, recolor it
  to the corresponding legend color; leave existing teal pixels, the center,
  and the black border unchanged.

Key insight
- The colored output pixels are not derived from the teal motif shape; they
  are the fixed position labels for the missing cells of each 3x3 interior.

Rebuild the foreground rectangles as a largest-to-smallest lower-left nesting.

Input structure
- A periodic wallpaper background is overlaid by foreground colors that each form a rectangular frame or solid rectangle.
- The largest foreground rectangle is the output frame; smaller foreground rectangles are the objects to nest inside it.
- A frame may be partially hidden by a smaller rectangle, but its visible pixels still determine its bbox.

Rule
- Ignore the wallpaper and crop the result to the largest foreground rectangle's bbox size.
- Sort foreground rectangles by bbox area from largest to smallest.
- Reconstruct each frame or solid rectangle, placing every next smaller rectangle in the lower-left of the current rectangle's usable region.

Key insight
- The scattered background colors are not objects; the meaningful order is the unique descending rectangle size chain, and each step nests into the previous rectangle's lower-left interior.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
