Paint the top-connected middle channel between two orange path components teal.

Input structure
- The background is black.
- One foreground color forms exactly two 4-connected one-pixel-wide path components.
- Optional non-background control pixels may sit in the channel between the two paths.

Rule
- Dilate each path component by one cell in the 8-neighborhood and intersect the two dilations; this gives the one-cell-wide middle channel.
- A control pixel in that channel is a blocker only when its 4-neighbors touch fewer than both path components; otherwise it is part of the channel and is repainted.
- After removing blockers, paint the channel component connected to the top edge teal and keep all other pixels unchanged.

Key insight
- The desired pixels are not found by region filling; they are the geometric overlap of the two paths' one-cell halos, with weakly attached control pixels splitting the channel.

Move each vertical stream of pixels into a bottom-aligned centered pile.

Input structure
- A mostly background grid contains one or more vertical source columns of
  foreground pixels.
- Each source column has n^2 foreground pixels, and the top-to-bottom color
  sequence splits into monochrome groups of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Rule
- Clear the canvas to background.
- For each source column, read the foreground colors from top to bottom and
  rebuild them at the bottom below the same column as odd-width centered
  rows of lengths 1, 3, 5, ...

Key insight
- The scattered vertical pixels are falling grains; a square number of
  grains decomposes into the odd row widths of a centered pyramid.

Move each isolated colored pixel into the one-cell frame around a grey 2x2 block.

Input structure:
- Background is the dominant color.
- Grey foreground objects are solid 2x2 anchor blocks.
- Every other non-background, non-grey cell is a colored singleton source.

Rule:
- Keep the grey anchors fixed and clear all colored singleton source pixels.
- For each singleton and each anchor, the normal destination is the cell reached by
  clamping the pixel into the anchor's one-cell outer frame.
- If a diagonally outside singleton has an exact 8-direction sightline into an anchor,
  also allow the cell just before the first grey pixel on that ray.
- Choose distinct destinations that minimize total king-move distance; at equal
  distance prefer exact sightlines, then the shorter Manhattan movement.

Key insight: The grey 2x2 blocks define magnetic frames; conflicts are resolved
structurally by nearest-frame assignment rather than by color identity.

Transform each 9x9 panel by mirroring across its center guide line or filling all four block slots from its lone exemplar.

Input structure
The grid is made of 9x9 panels separated by one-cell-wide grid lines. Each
panel has four monochrome 3x3 slots at the quadrant positions, with either a
full non-background center row, a full non-background center column, or no
guide line.

Rule
A panel with a full center column is reflected left-to-right, and a panel
with a full center row is reflected top-to-bottom. A panel with no guide line
has exactly one slot color that appears once and one slot color that appears
three times; recolor all four slots to the once-occurring slot color.

Key insight
The center guide line encodes the mirror axis, while panels without a guide
line are completed by copying the structurally unique slot color.

Cycle each solid odd-sided square to the next smaller centered square, wrapping a single pixel to a 9x9 square.

Input structure:
- The grid has one dominant background color.
- Every foreground object is a separated 4-connected monochrome solid square.
- Square side lengths are odd and belong to the cycle 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Rule:
- Clear the canvas to the background.
- Keep each square's color and center.
- Replace side length n by n - 2 when n > 1; replace side length 1 by side length 9.

Key insight:
- The visible operation is on square size, not color: side lengths cycle 1 -> 9 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.

Rotate each blue-started chain of bottom-aligned vertical bars into horizontal bars resting on the same baseline.
Input structure
- The grid has a background and bottom-aligned, one-cell-wide vertical bars.
- Blue bars are markers; red bars are body bars that may be chained after a marker.
Rule
- Starting at each blue bar, repeatedly include the next red bar whose column is exactly the current bar's column plus the current bar's height.
- Clear every included vertical bar, then redraw each included bar horizontally to the right from its original bottom cell, with length equal to its vertical height.
- Red bars that are not reached from a blue marker remain unchanged.
Key insight
- A vertical bar's height is also the width it occupies after rotation, so the chain follows immediate horizontal contact after each rotated bar.

Composite two pattern tiles into a fourth panel using flood-fill from an indicator pixel.

Input structure:
- Four 5×5 panels in one row, border-separated.
- Panel 0: cue pixels = wall boundary (8-connected, edge-to-edge, through center)
           + one 8-isolated indicator pixel.
- Panels 1–2: source patterns. Panel 3: blank (to fill).

Rule:
- Flood-fill (4-conn) from indicator, blocked by wall → inside region.
- Inside → non-bg from panel 1; outside → non-bg from panel 2.
- Wall → panel 1 if non-bg; panel 2 fallback when wall is 4-connected.

Key insight: The cue panel's isolated indicator and wall partition the tile into inside/outside masks that select between the two source panels.

Recolor vertical bars by legend-driven rank selection.

Input structure:
- bg = background. Top-left: monochrome blocks touching row 0; each has color K and height k.
- Main grid: vertical bars capped top and bottom by a single color, with solid-color interiors.

Rule:
- For each legend entry (K, k), find vertical bars capped by K.
- Rank bars by interior length (longest = rank 1).
- Recolor the rank-k bar's interior to K.

Key insight: Legend height is a rank index into length-sorted bars, not a literal size.

Move each maroon marker toward the blue rectangle and recolor the rectangle red.

Input structure
A background canvas contains one solid blue rectangular object and several isolated
maroon marker pixels. Each marker is horizontally or vertically aligned with the
rectangle and lies outside it.

Rule
Start with a background canvas, repaint the blue rectangle red, and move each
maroon marker straight toward the rectangle along its row or column. Exactly one
marker is strictly closer to the rectangle than all others and enters the
rectangle boundary; every other marker lands in the adjacent exterior cell just
outside its aligned side.

Key insight
The single entering marker is the unique global nearest marker to the rectangle,
not the nearest marker on each of the four sides.

Assemble the foreground objects by docking equal-colored boundary markers edge-to-edge.

Input structure
The grid has a dominant background color and several 4-connected multicolor foreground
objects.  One foreground color is the body color; the less frequent foreground colors are
boundary connector markers, and each marker color appears once as a free end or twice as a
matched docking pair.

Rule
Crop each foreground object to its bounding box and translate the objects so that the two
occurrences of every paired connector color touch on their exposed boundary sides.  Preserve
each object's orientation and colors, then return the tight crop around the assembled
foreground on the original background color.

Key insight
The colored marker pixels are ports: matching colors specify which objects must touch, and
the marker's side of its object determines the direction of the translation.

Repair noisy periodic patterns inside frame-delimited grid regions.

Input structure:
- Frame color (most common) forms full rows/cols, dividing the grid into rectangular regions.
- bg (second most common) fills empty space; each region contains a small colored tile repeated periodically with a few corrupted pixels.

Rule:
- For each region, find the bounding box of non-bg content.
- Infer the smallest repeating tile that explains the pattern (majority vote per residue position), requiring it repeat at least 2x per axis.
- Replace the region with the clean tiled version.

Key insight: Tile dimensions are unknown and must be inferred; prefer the smallest tile with genuine repetition over one that memorizes the entire region.

Assemble and place enlarged sprites on a canvas using legend-panel instructions.

Input structure:
- Color-6 separators divide the grid into a left legend column and a main canvas.
- Each legend panel has (top to bottom): a unit sprite, a frame template, a 5x5 bordered square with a position-marker pixel, and a 3x3 rotation clock-hand.

Rule:
- Tile the unit sprite into each active cell of the frame to build an enlarged composite.
- Rotate the composite per the clock-hand direction (up=0, right=90, down=180, left=270 degrees).
- Place it on the canvas anchored at the position encoded by the marker pixel's row/col in the bordered square's 3x3 inner grid.

Key insight: The marker pixel's position in a 3x3 grid jointly encodes vertical and horizontal anchor alignment (start/middle/end).

Remove diagonal staircase noise and complete broken straight lines.

Input structure:
- bg = background; one foreground color fg forming axis-aligned lines.
- Some fg pixels form 45° diagonal chains (8-connected but 4-disconnected from lines).

Rule:
- Delete all diagonal-only fg pixels (those with no orthogonal fg neighbor, only diagonal ones).
- Fill short gaps in horizontal/vertical lines where a deleted diagonal was nearby.
- Prune remaining diagonal-adjacent leaf pixels near former diagonal sites.

Key insight: Diagonal pixels are hints marking where a straight line is broken; their span sets the maximum gap size to fill.

Swap paired marker pixels across the largest foreground-color barrier, placing them just outside the barrier segment.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- One foreground color is the unique most frequent non-background color; its pixels form the stationary barrier.
- Other foreground pixels are single markers, sometimes paired on opposite sides of one contiguous barrier segment in the same row or column.

Rule:
- Scan each row and column that crosses exactly one contiguous barrier segment.
- If the line has exactly one marker on each side of that segment, erase both source markers and place each marker in the cell immediately beyond the opposite side of the segment.
- Lines with markers on only one side are unchanged; the barrier remains unchanged.

Key insight:
- The marker pairing is local to a row or column, and the destination is defined by the nearest cells outside the intervening barrier segment, not by the original distance from the barrier.

Replace the outlined object with the outside contour of that outline in the marker color.

Input structure:
- A dominant background surrounds one 8-connected foreground outline.
- The outline is the unique largest foreground color.
- One or more smaller interior colors are inside the outline; the marker color
  is the unique smallest non-outline color.

Rule:
- Erase all original foreground pixels to background.
- Paint every background pixel that is 4-adjacent to the outline with the
  marker color.
- Keep the grid shape unchanged.

Key insight: The colored interior marker supplies the paint color, while the
largest outline supplies only the contour whose outside edge is traced.

Fill each centered square ring with the color of the marker at that ring distance.

Input structure
The input is an odd square grid with a dominant background color and one
non-background marker for every Chebyshev distance from the grid center.
Rule
The output replaces the background with concentric square rings centered on
the middle cell; every cell at distance d from the center takes the color of
the unique marker whose distance from the center is d.
Key insight
The scattered markers are not objects to move; their Chebyshev distances
form a palette for the centered square rings.

Detect thin '+' shapes in a single foreground color and recolor them to teal.

Input structure:
- bg = most common color.
- One foreground color (e.g. yellow) forms various shapes on the bg, some of which are small '+' crosses.

Rule:
- A '+' center is any foreground pixel whose 4 orthogonal neighbors are also foreground.
- Recolor each such center and its 4 neighbors to teal (8).
- All other pixels remain unchanged.

Key insight: Only compact 5-cell crosses qualify — a pixel embedded in a larger filled region also satisfies the neighbor check, so the rule highlights every local '+' motif, not just isolated ones.

Move the small colored sprite into the hollow frame by stretching its shape to the frame interior.

Input structure:
- The background is the dominant color.
- There are exactly two foreground colors: one forms a complete rectangular
  one-pixel-thick frame, and the other forms one 4-connected sprite outside it.
- The frame interior is initially background.

Rule:
- Clear the original sprite from its outside location.
- Map the sprite bbox to the frame interior bbox, sending bbox extremes to
  interior extremes.
- Draw straight horizontal or vertical segments between mapped positions of
  adjacent sprite pixels, then fill any enclosed background region inside
  those drawn segments.

Key insight:
The outside sprite is a miniature line/fill diagram for the frame interior,
not a bitmap to scale by block replication.

Draw a polyline by decoding 3x3 glyph instructions read across a divided grid.

Input structure:
- Left of a full-height vertical divider: 3x3 colored glyphs on bg.
- Right of divider: a single gray (5) start pixel.

Rule:
- Remove the divider; shift the gray start into the left canvas.
- Read glyphs in column-major order (left→right, top→bottom).
- Each glyph's shape (pixel area) encodes a segment: area 4 → down 2, area 5 → right 3, area 6 → left 4, area 7 → left 2.
- Append segments sequentially, stepping down one cell between each.

Key insight: Glyph pixel count (area) uniquely determines both segment length and direction — the shape itself is the instruction.

Recolor each placeholder object according to its normalized shape while leaving the background fixed.

Input structure
A same-size grid with one dominant background color and one foreground
placeholder color forming separated 4-connected objects.

Rule
Replace every placeholder object by the color assigned to its exact
translation-normalized mask; all background pixels remain unchanged.

Key insight
The input objects are a shape legend with repeated instances: identical
masks always receive identical colors, independent of their position.

你的任务：
以参考题为标杆，运用发散性思维进行创新扩展。请发挥创造力，构思全新且巧妙的推理谜题。用中文创造全新的 ARC 谜题描述。
创新方式包括但不限于：
**机制重组**：将多道参考题各自的核心机制提取出来，组合成一个新的多步管道，用到新的场景。
**机制变异**：取几道参考题的核心机制，以机制为基础进行创新并与其他多种机制进行创新重组，使解题路径发生质变而非量变。
**逆向构造**：取一道参考题的输出模式，思考"什么样的输入规则能产生类似的输出结构但需要完全不同的推理过程"。

严格使用下面的 XML 风格格式输出：

<new_puzzle>
- `description`：一句话概述题目的变换目标。
- `Input structure`：输入网格中有哪些对象、背景、标记、边界或组件。
- `Rule`：从输入到输出的确定性变换规则。
- `Key insight`：解题所需的核心洞见。
</new_puzzle>

请一次性生成5个`<new_puzzle>`，若有较多合适的创新，也可以生成更多，不设上限，但不要输出额外解释。

注意事项：
1. 任务不应依赖大量先验知识或复杂计算，而应依赖对模式、结构与空间关系的直觉推理。
2. 关于"计算"的边界：
   - **允许使用**（这些都是人类能心算的视觉量）：数像素 / 孔洞 / 对象 / 邻居（≤10 量级）、比大小、按某个可见属性排序、奇偶判断、取最大 / 最小、用一个计数值作为另一个等量几何量（如 N 个像素 → 长度 N 的射线、面积 N → 边长 N）、判断接触 / 相邻 / 包含、粗略中心位置（簇的视觉中点）、"距离"作为"几步"而不是公式等人类能够直观感受计算的内容。
   - **禁止使用**（这些是算法量而非视觉量，会迫使解题者依赖公式而非视觉直觉）：曼哈顿 / 欧氏 / Chebyshev 距离作为精确查表键、凸包面积、二进制位编码 / 位运算、模运算（取模） / 余数、拓扑距离（BFS / 最短路 / 跳数）、精确几何质心坐标、凸角 / 凹角计数等复杂且不易被看出来的计算都是禁止使用的。
3. 问题必须能从少量示例中推断出来（通常为 3 对训练样例 + 1 个测试样例）。设计时从人类解题者的视觉角度思考：规则涉及的所有关键要素（对象、关系、属性）必须在网格上肉眼可见，不应依赖人眼无法直接观察到的隐含信息（例如颜色id和颜色亮度是禁止使用的）或需要推算的隐藏属性。规则背后的逻辑本身可以有一定挑战性，但解题所需的所有线索必须能从网格中直接获取。
4. 生成的问题描述旨在促进后续用于创建题目网格的代码生成。因此，对输入 / 输出网格的描述以及规则总结必须极其详细；语言风格应易于理解；对于特定对象（如箭头），必须在描述中明确其绘制方式。
5. 描述谜题时避免使用 0 或 1 这类颜色编号；应使用颜色名称，例如 "red"。可用颜色如下：Black、Blue、Red、Green、Yellow、Grey、Magenta、Orange、Azure、Maroon。
6. 新题的核心推理机制应明显不同——即从观察样例到归纳规则的认知路径不同，而不仅仅是场景、对象或颜色不同。
7. 题目难度应来自机制的隐蔽性而非步骤数。用参考题作为难度标尺——如果你生成的题一个样例就能猜到规则，说明机制太透明，需要加深隐蔽性。
8. 优先从参考题的机制出发进行重组或推演，而非从物理隐喻出发。物理隐喻容易导致大量题目归结为一种模式，例如"沿方向移动到阻挡处停止"。
9. 题目的难度优先来自规则的**结构层数**，而不是单一步骤的复杂度。关于"结构层数"的判定标准：**只有解题者需要主动推理才能完成的步骤才算一层**。肉眼一扫即可获得的信息（如"找到缺口在哪一侧"、"数出像素个数"、"识别哪个对象最大"）不构成独立的推理层——它们只是变换的前置输入，不增加认知难度。真正的多层结构是指每一层都需要解题者发现一个非显然的规律。以两层结构为例：
   - ✗ 伪两层："找到缺口方向"→"把东西推到对面" — 第一步肉眼可见，实际只有一层推理。
   - ✓ 真两层："通过孔洞数量匹配颜色图例"→"用匹配到的颜色重绘对象" — 两步都需要非平凡的归纳。

   如果你发现自己写出的题只是"对每个对象，根据它的某个属性做某变换"的单步规则，请引入一个需要主动推理的前置步骤。**用堆叠 tie-break 规则或复杂数学公式来"加难度"是劣解；用多一层需要归纳的结构嵌套来"加难度"才是好解**。
10. 在符合ARC题目和提示词要求的基础上，鼓励尝试创新规则为多层结构的题目，不局限于两层，可以创新三层或四层结构的题目，但不可为了多结构层数违背要求。

生成后对生成的题执行以下四项审查（审查内容不需要保存到文件）：
1. 原创性
  新题不可与上述参考题相同或类似，不可只是替换颜色、方向、对象类型等表层要素。判断标准：新题的核心推理路径应与任何一道参考题不同。
2. 确定性
  规则完全确定，同一输入只能产生唯一输出，每一步操作都有明确定义。
3. 可实现性
  所有必要细节都已给出——对象如何生成、如何识别、如何变换、边界情况如何处理，读完描述后可以直接写代码。
4. ARC 合规性
  网格尺寸合理（≤30×30），使用颜色不超过 10 种，规则复杂度适中，人类能从 3-5 个样例中发现规律。没有使用上述注意事项第二条禁止使用的复杂计算。
